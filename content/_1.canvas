It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor, and change.

Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, you are already free!\"\n> -Dan Millman, *The Way of the Peaceful Warrior*","x":700,"y":1282,"width":720,"height":1198},
