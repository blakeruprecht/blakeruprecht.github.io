I can make music anywhere I go with my portable music-maker -- my voice box. Fortunately, I can't tell how bad I am, so every time I sing in the car, I enjoy my own [music](/music).

## Four chords and the truth
I hardly know uke, just a few basic chords. In the spirit of country music, that's enough.
