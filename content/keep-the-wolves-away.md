I feel hot breath on my neck as I run forward, bogged down by mud and debris. One nips at my shoes, opening up a whole in the left side of the upper. Another snatches a hole in my pants. One up them knocks dirt into my mouth, a problem that will have to be professionally repaired. I lose my vision as my contacts fall out from running, I have to rely on my old glasses which restrict my peripherals.

Now they've gotten to my house. I've had to flee, and they're chewing away at the walls. One of them bit into my store of food, ruining days worth of provisions.

They don't stop chasing me.

I've had to adjust my running form on the fly. Shorten my strides, rely less on outright power and plan for the long game.

I thought the wolves would look scary, but they don't. I hardly even feel the fear, it's so subtle. Like a tapeworm undetected, I don't even know it's eating away at me until I look back at the decision and see the error.

It's just groceries and rent. And medical costs. And tool maintenance.

Maybe I'll just get a quick job to pay off my bills, and then I'll start living the life I want. Maybe I'll just get quick part-time job to stay afloat, and then I'll start living the life I want. Maybe I'll just sit in this house for a year and make no forward progress. Then I'll start living.

I can see the hesitation all over my recent path. The indecision masking the fear that is so ugly and huge I haven't acknowledged it even to myself. I wanted permission, some sign that I was on the right path. A published essay. Somebody telling me they'd never read better writing. A hawk crossing my path at just the right time.

None of that happened.

There have been no signs, no helpful hints, no tricks. Just doubt and uncertainty hanging over my head everyday. I keep going back to the same strategies that aren't working, sending out tons of applications just to receive hundreds of rejection emails. "We're pursuing candidates who better fit this role." Where do I fit in?

I've been so confused at every turn, constantly reevaluating and coming up with new plans and stressing the fuck out every time the new plan doesn't work. I'm so fucking sick of it, sick of grinding away to get positions I don't even want to keep living a lifestyle I hate. I don't know what the right answer for me is, but I know for sure it's not continuing to sit at this stupid desk in front of this window I can't open because of the car traffic in this house I don't like with roommates who don't get along in a city that screams against my soul.

I've been so *fearful* at every turn, constantly doubting myself and coming up with backup plans and stressing the fuck out every time the new plan doesn't align with my heart. I'm sick of lying to myself and everyone else. I always knew this lifestyle wouldn't work for me. I left my parents house with no regrets. I left the house I shared with my first girlfriend, terrified of being tied down to a boring place. I moved into this boring place thinking things would be different since my friends were here. Now I'm just bored by my friends.

There are great adventures to be had in this life, just not sitting at this desk putting my life on hold to follow a path that was never meant for me.

Here's the truth -- staying in Denver is a losing battle, and every day I stay is one day closer to my eventual demise. I'm wasting my life away waffling in indecision.
