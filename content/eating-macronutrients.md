Humans eat food for [energy](/eating-calories) first and foremost, but the body is also made of food. Food makes up our bones, organs, heart, lungs, skin, cells, tissues, etc. Everything in a human is made of food. The major building blocks of food/human are called macronutrients. They are large chemical molecules which our bodies don't make, and need to eat in order to make use of them for [living](/living).

The Macros:
- **Water** -- 0 cal/g. Technically the most important macronutrients for humans, but most people don't eat water... so [drink](/drinking) plenty.
- **Protein** -- 4 cal/g. Builds all muscle on the body, and many other cells. The most important macro to pay attention to, since humans need this to stay strong. There are really 10 essential amino acids, but all you need to know is that any meat (e.g. chicken, beef, fish) has all of them, and any combo of grain + legume (e.g. rice + beans, bread + lentils) has all of them too.
	- The general recommendation is 0.7 g/lb to [build muscle](/eating-anabolic), but that is a rough estimate.
- **Fats** -- 9 cal/g. Essential for building cells, neurons, etc. The only essential lipids are Omega-3 and Omega-6 (the two types of unsaturated fats).
	- **Omega-6 Unsaturated Fat** - Easily found in most unsaturated fats like Olive Oil, in abundance.
	- **Omega-3 Unsaturated Fat** - Found in most unsaturated fats like Olive Oil, but in lower quantities. Fish are very high in Omega-3s, so that's why people recommend eating fish 2-3x per week or taking a fish oil supplement.
	- *Saturated Fats* -- not essential, totally fine though.
	- *Trans Fats* -- not essential, actively harmful.
- **Carbohydrates** -- 4 cal/g. Technically not essential, but also the most convenient and perfectly healthy source of raw [calories](/eating-calories). There's nothing wrong with white rice either, it's just missing some of the micronutrients, fiber, and slow-burning carbs brown rice also has.
	- **Fiber** -- 0 cal/g. While technically a carb, fiber just passes through us and gets pooped out. It's useful to provide structure to our turds.
- **Alcohol** -- 7 cal/g. Not essential! Gets burned first.
