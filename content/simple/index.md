Simple living is natural, easy, frugal, spiritual, sustainable, economical, healthy, fun, c
onnected, and anarchist. All of the great teachers of the world have advocated for simple l
iving: Pooh Bear, Hobbes (not Calvin), dogs & cats, Baloo, all trees, Uncle Iroh, Lao Tzu,
the Lorax. Seriously, who doesn't want to live like a dog?

Why simple living? Well, life is tough, and everyone wants to be happy. The "happiness curve" probably looks logarithmic, like the image above. As you spend more time/money/energy/attention (x-axis) towards improving it, the results (happiness, y-axis) start to taper off. Not having food can make you so unhappy you die, whereas having 10 million hamburgers doesn't make you much happier than having two (unless you get the chance to share them). Many people around the world do not have access to clean water and proper nutrition.

Many other people around the world spend an enormous amount of time and energy buying stuff to try to increase the happiness, wihtout realizing that this is foolish.

You may have heard of the hierarchy of needs, but a much better way to think about it is the circle of needs. Different needs are more important for different people at different times of their life. Any one of these, when lacking, can contribute to serious health issues, mental or physical. While many people around the world suffer from lack of food and basic security, many people also suffer from lack of community and belonging. I have broken down simple living into the following four categories.

- Physical fitness
- Social belonging
- Mental stimulation
- Spiritual grounding

## Physical Fitness

**MENTAL HEALTH**
Brain biochemistry can be improved using meditation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or prescribed medication. Otherwise, a lot of mental health is related to other health factors being out of wack, like improper diet and lack of exercise [Haidt].

**SLEEP AND SUNLIGHT**
Sleep plenty (6-10 hrs depending on person) and maintain a consistent wakeup time most days (>80% of your days). View morning sunlight for 10-60 mins and evening sunlight for >10mins to establish circadian rhythym. Avoid any bright lights after sundown [Huberman].

**HYGIENE**
Maintain teeth health by brushing the teeth twice per day, and flossing once per day to remove mineral buildups that form on the teeth as a result of eating simple sugars (my dentist said I wouldn't have to floss if I followed the Mediterranean diet perfectly, dunno if this is fully accurate). Get a dental checkup/cleaning every 6 months.

Maintain eye health by wearing sunglasses when outside, except for when waking up with the sun. Get an eye exam every year from an optometrist.

Maintain skin health by protecting the skin from the sun using clothing and sunscreen. Face sunscreen should possibly be worn everyday. Moisturize morning and night. Clean the skin with natural soap and fresh water daily. Clean hair with water daily, and natural soap sometimes (dunno how often). Clean textiles, like clothes, sheets, and towels, that touch the skin regularly, like every week, with water and natural detergent. Get a skin exam every year from a dermatologist.

Maintain general hygiene by visiting a general physician once per year for a regular checkup. Clean your surroundings, especially bathroom and kitchen, every week. This means disinfecting surfaces, cleaning mold, sweeping dust, etc. This is much easier to do when all surfaces are free of clutter (flat-surface clutter is a pet-peeve of mine).

**MOVEMENT**
Otherwise known as exercise since we started leading sedentary lives, movement is essential to our health to both feel good, and perform well. There are nine physical adaptations the body can make in response to movement, which are:
- cardiovascular anaerobic endurance: how efficiently the body can move at max speeds when not using oxygen
- cardiovascular aerobic endurance: how efficiently the body can move using oxygen 
- cardiovascular long-duration endurance: how long the body can operate and do activities for
- muscular technique: how well the muscle can move the body in space
- muscular endurance: how many times the muscle can contract
- muscular strength: how much weight the muscle can move
- muscular speed: how fast the muscle can contract
- muscular power: strength x speed
- muscular hypertrophy: the size of the muscle

**Form**. So all the movement we do in life affects those 9 things, there is nothing else. For example, balance is not a physical adaptation, it's a result of muscular technique and strength. This list helps show that all movement, whether sitting, standing, laying, walking, lifting, jumping, etc., has a proper form related to it (muscular technique). Even breathing, the most basic movement of all, has a proper technique. Nose-breathing, using the diaphagrm and upright spinal posture, tongue on the roof of the mouth, is the proper way to breathe. Posture is essential in all movement, and I would recommend that you learn the proper form for breathing, sitting, standing, walking, running, and all types of lifting before seriously trying to improve at them. Also, it's generally a bad idea to sit/stand in the same place for too long, so try to get up and move as often as possible, ideally every 20 minutes.

**Cardio**. Walking improves our long-duration endurance and aerobic endurance, but only to a point. To improve cardio, we have to do activity that raises our heart rate. A good way to think about it is with the Zone descriptions:
- Zone 1: basically just walking
- Zone 2: as fast as you can move while still nose-breathing
- Zone 3: tempo, 80%, pretty hard training
- Zone 4: threshold, as fast as you can run and still use oxygen
- Zone 5: all out, maximum effort, no longer uses oxygen, but uses lactate (this is the anaerobic zone). 

The cool thing is, zones 1-4 all use oxygen, so a majority of your cardio training can just be zone 2 cardio, which is like a light jog. Or go swimming, rowing, bicycling, whatever, I prefer exercises where I can maintain an upright posture (running, skipping) to counteract sitting. Try to get some zone 2 cardio in everyday, up to a maximum of 180 mins of zone 2 training per week. It's great to incporate cardio into your everyday life by walking/bicycling/etc. as much as possible.

What about Zones 3-5? Well, do that once or twice per week. This could just be sprinting up a hill 10 times. Doing some max effort jumps. Playing a sport all out. Run two miles as fast as you can (zone 4). It's very beneficial to muscular growth to do zone 5 training, as well as testosterone. I think the mental benefits are even greater than the physical benefits with all out training.

**Muscles**. What about the muscles? Well, if you're working on doing everything in your day-to-day life with proper form, including your cardio training, that serves as the foundation of your muscles. All other stretching and strength training is done to target muscles that you're not hitting in the rest of your life. Yoga probably isn't enough training to strengthen your muscles, though it's great for mobility to target posture deficits. If you sit all day, you'll probably want to perform the following four stretches:
- elephant stretch (for the hamstrings)
- couch stretch (for the hip flexors, quads, glutes)
- inner thigh stretch
- 90/90s (for the hips (not a muscle))

As well as those stretches, core strength can be a massive issue for many people. Dr. Stuart McGill recommends the following three exercises to build a core of steel:
- curl-up
- bird dog
- side planks

As far as strength training is concerned, KISS. The basic movement patterns are pushing, pulling, squatting, and lifting. The main lifts are the Back Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift, which cover all of these major movement patterns and target every muscle in the body. Master these three, and you'll be extremely strong and functional. 

A great altnerative to lifting for a safer, less-equipment approach is bodyweight exercises. The foundation of bodyweight exercises are the pushup and the pullup for the upper body, and squats and lunges for the lower body. These will also target all of the muscles in the body. K Boges on Youtube is the best resource for learning more about bodyweight training.

**NUTRITION**
Nutrition is by far the most complicated health topic, but I will sum it up by saying follow the Mediterranean diet. The body needs to intake energy to fuel our movements and rebuild cells. We need to eat food because our body doesn't have the chemical mechanisms to build fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and chemical elements (minerals) from scratch, so we have to eat stuff that already has those. We can use those for energy, but carbohydrates provide a really easy to use energy source for the body, so those are good too. We need to eat the proper quantity, which is measure in units of energy, typically kilocalories or joules. Eat more than you need to gain weight, eat less than you need to lose weight, eat the exact amount you need to maintain weight.

The Mediterranean diet emphasizes eating lots of varied vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and olive oil. It also includes poultry and certain dairy products. You can still have other types of meat if you want. The main point is to limit processed foods, which contain lots of junk the body doesn't need, and is actively harmful, like trans fats, simple sugars, excess sodium, etc. The body needs 10 essential amino acids, all of which can be obtained with a combination of whole-grains and legumes. The body needs saturated and unsaturated fats, both of which are found in olive oil, but omega-3s need to be supplemented with the occasional eating of fish/dairy/coconuts. The vitamins, minerals, and fiber come from eating whole foods. Amino acids and fatty acids can provide energy, but whole-grains are a great source of carbohydrates, which are a cheap source of energy, so they're good too.

The human body needs to replenish the water it loses every day through breathing, sweating, urination, and defecation. Each person needs to drink a different amount, so drink when you are thirsty. Check by verifying that your pee isn't yellor/brown, that's the danger zone.

**TOOLS**
I've yet to mention owning a Lamborghini, because it does not improve happiness and is not necessary at all for happiness. Hell, possessions in general don't improve happiness, unless they are tools. A tool is an item that serves a specific purpose. Anything else is a toy, and the research shows that toys do not increase happiness. Tools remove pain from our lives, but the added pleasure of a toy typically goes away after a few hours/days.

All that's really needed is some clothing to stay covered and warm, some basic tools related to your occupation, a vehicle (preferably a bike, maybe a car) to get from point A to point B, and a simple place to live that has a place to sleep, a bathroom to clean in, a kitchen to cook and store food, and a living area to build relationships in. Of course, natural light and some plants or a garden are a must. Most everything else is excess fluff that doesn't increase human happiness, and is therefore, a total waste of time, money, and energy. Sure, toys are fun, whatever, but I have a pretty good feeling that most people are buying stuff to fill happiness hole sin their life, and are better off focusing on physical fitness, social belonging, mental stimulation, and spiritual grounding first, and then seeing if they still want to buy XYZ product that marketers are telling you you'll be happier with, at your expense and their gain. I've tried it, it's an endless cycle of craving, getting, and unhappiness.

## Social belonging

Security. Lone wolfs are not a thing. Mountain men who go off by themselves to live in the woods mostly all end up dead. That's why I view security as a part of your relationships to others rather than as a personal task. We cannot survive in the wild on our own, we need a tribe. We are not like cats, we cannot survive in the world on our own, we are like dogs, we need a pack to survive. Even jobs, which bring us financial security, are the direct result of our social relationships with others.

Family

Friends

Community

Partner

## REFERENCES
- Haidt, Jonathan. *The Happiness Hypothesis*. A fantastic book by a researcher of behavioral psychology at UVA, Haidt sums up most of the current research of human happiness with one simple formula.  
	- Haidt teaches the simple formula H = S + C + V. (H)appiness refers to your subjective feeling of well-being. It is dependent on three broad factors.
	- The (S)etpoints of your brain biochemistry. These are the product of your genetics and lived experiences up until this point. Some people are just naturally happier than others, it's unfair. The only scientifically proven ways to change brain biochem are through meditation (seriously), cognitive-behavioral therapy (other types of therapy aren't as effective), and prescription medication (self-prescribed doesn't count). 
	- The (C)onditions of your life refer to enduring factors like where you live, what career you have, the family and friends around you. These are hard to change, but definitely malleable. The research shows that it's much more important to remove negatives and annoyances from your life than adding positives, due to hedonic adaptation. For example, moving to a city without smog pollution with increase your happiness much more than moving to a warmer city. Making enough money to not worry about paying your bills will make you much more happy than being rich.
	- The (V)oluntary actions of your day-to-day life are the easiest to change, and thus, the biggest potential area for happiness improvement for most people. Haidt's advice is to stop focusing on pretty much everything except for loving relationships and flow activities. This is obvious to me, when I look into my heart, anything that isn't contributing to flow or love probably isn't worth a single damn.
- *Harvard Study of Adult Development* by Harvard Researchers is an 80+ year long study that once again shows that *community* is what's important in life, not prestige, money, success, or any of that other bullshit.
- Huberman, Andrew. *Huberman Lab Podcast*. Hubes is a Stanfard researcher of biology, interviews other resesearch scientists and doctors about how to be healthy. If you want to learn more about the importance of sleep and sunlight, daily exercise, proper nutrition, or anything else related to health, check out this podcast. Huberman sums it up as the following, in no particular order:
	- sleep plenty with consistent wakeup time
	- viewing of morning and evening sunlight
	- daily exercise/movement
	- daily drinking of water and eating of proper nutrition
	- relationships
	- stress-relief (similar to Haidt's S category)
	- oral health & gut microbiome
	- spiritual grounding, purpose, & mission
- Albom, Mitch. *Tuesdays with Morrie*. This book emphasizes the importance of community, love, and serving others through your work above all else. If you're noticing a common theme, it's that stuff and consumption is never included in this discussion, happiness is all about connecting with the people around you and creating stuff that makes you feel flow.
