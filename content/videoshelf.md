## Movies
- **Everything Everywhere All at Once** - Waymond Wong is a great character. 
- **The Big Lebowski - Coen brothers** (film) Dudeism has got to be one of the most relaxing philosophies ever espoused. Great movie, great ideas, let's just chill and go bowling.
- **V for Vendetta - James McTeigue** (film) A revolutionary film that taught me about rebellion and what it means to live based on your own code. V fights for what is right, and his eloquent sobriquets leave me loving words even more.
- **Captain Fantastic - Matt Ross** (film) Shows the lifestyle I dream of living with my family, both the extreme version, and then the toned back version. Captivating, fantastic depiciton of living off the beaten path.

## TV Shows
- **Avatar The Last Airbender - Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko**. The best tv program ever, four perfect seasons, full of lessons, most of them coming from Uncle Iroh. For him alon, this is a top piece of media ever.
- **Spongebob Squarepants - Stephen Hillenburg**. The animation alone is hilarious. Some of the most classic jokes every written. Spongebob single-handedly defined my generation's humor in the sense that I've asked people if they've watched it, and the answer defines whether they are funny or not. Almost. It's that important.
- **South Park - Trey Parker and Matt Stone**. Hilarious. Always makes me laugh, always whacks me out. Haha, great.
- **Californication - Tom Kapinos**. Hank Moody is hilarious. Not because of his womanizing, but the words. The voiceovers, the fighting spirit, the virility of the show as a whole.
- **Sherlock (BBC)**
- **Rick & Morty**
- **Longmire**
- **White Collar**
- **Archer**
