- **Enough**: I am alive. That is enough.
- **Belief**: I believe that my life matters, that I matter, that I'm a living being who wants to keep living.
- **Interbeing**. I exist in relation. I am not separate from the forest, the field, the family, the world.
- **Stability**: I'm alive and I believe that I deserve to continue living.
- **Compassion**: If I'm a living being and I want to stay alive, then surely everybody else does to. All living beings deserve compassion.
- **Responsibility**: Since I'm alive, my job is to respond to what's in front of me. I can't control what happens to me, life is full of random pain. I can just control how I respond.
- **Alignment**: I align my actions with what I feel inside, my belief and responsibility.
- **Reciprocity**: Others matter and have helped me immensely, which I am forever grateful for. I reciprocate my gratitude by showing love to other living beings.
- **The Golden Rule.** Treat others how you wish to be treated. Don’t just seek fairness—enact it. Create a good environment for others to play.

- "Epiousion" is a Koine Greek word meaning something like "bread for today and tomorrow." The Sermon on the Mount is widely regarded as a distillation of Jesus' teachings, and I find this word particularly interesting. The point is to request our *epiousion* from God and nothing more, to request a life of poverty basically, and be happy with that, and then all good things will stem from it.

> Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place. And I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you permanently there if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.

> But it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!

> Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you want to be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that, and that ain't you! You're better than that!
