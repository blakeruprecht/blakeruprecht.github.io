Even though walkable cities are preferable, and [[bicycles]] are much more sustainable, cars are pretty useful in the USA.

It's better to have a car you love and take care of, than one you hate and feel like is a burden. It's two sides of the same coin.

Loving something, thinking it's cool, finding it pretty -- all biological features we can hack to improve car maintenance.

Buy a used car, as cheap as you can get. It's difficult for MPG and reliability to make up a $20k gulf over the course of a decade, the y-intercept dominates the car buying process.

Cars I love:
- Toyota 4Runner: A more convenient Jeep. The windows all close and lock, but in 10 seconds you can put down four windows, a rear window, and a sunroof. GOATed.
- Jeep Wrangler: The sexiest vehicle ever made, originally for fighting nazis in WWII, what's cooler than that? They're beautiful, too. Specifically, the TJ. The new JKUs are pretty cool, but them and the Broncos are both getting huge.
- Mazda 3 Wagon: The spirited wagon, with good handling. Small car though. In the same vein, the Subaru WRX STi, Audi RS6, Cadillac CTS-V Wagon, etc.
- Ford Mustang: Even smaller, even less practical, but way faster thanks to the big V8 under the hood. Classic American muscle, err, pony car. The other contender for pure sexy Americana is the Corvette -- all of them.
- Porsche 911: Mainly the air-cooled variety, probably the sexiest sports car ever made. Singer does ungodly cool things to them.
