## Unix Philosophy
Use the simplest tool for the job. If you don't need to code new programs -- don't. This is contrary to the modern ethos of solving invented problems.

Most everything program my laptop is running is 5-50 years old. Software has come a long way, but I'm also mostly operating as if my computer was from 1977 and it works just fine for the main things a computer does -- write, code. Browsing is easy, plus I've got a phone for that.

## Modern Linux
Linux is the only modern operating system that is free and open-source (unlike Microsoft's Windows and Apple's MacOS, which both cost money and are closed-source).

Linux can do everything Windows and MacOS can do -- open apps, connect to wifi, display the time, browse files, open the browser. Pretty simple stuff.

There are a lot of flavors of Linux and I've tried a bunch. There's practically no difference between Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, etc. I use Debian because it has an automatic installer, making the process significantly easier.

## Software I use
- Debian 12.5 (Linux operating system)
- GNOME 40 (desktop environment)
- Blackbox (terminal/file browsing)
- Obsidian (text editor)
- VSCode/Cursor (coding)
- Firefox (browser)

And that's pretty much all I have installed on my laptop now.
