title: The Most Beautiful Formula in Math
description: Math is a language, and like all language, has some particularly beautiful formulae. I'm still fuzzy on what this one does, but it sure looks pretty.

Why is it so pretty?

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$
- $e$ is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms
- $i$ is the imaginary unit, which by definition satisfies $i^2 = -1$
- $\pi$ is pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter

Euler's Identity is a special case of Euler's formula evaluated for $x = \pi$:
$$e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$$
It is an especially beautiful result in math because it relates five fundamental numbers in mathematics ($0, 1, e, \pi, i$) with the three most common operators in math (addition, multiplication, exponentiation).
