## General notes
Notes from Huberman's ["Toolkit for Sleep"](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/toolkit-for-sleep) 
- Most humans need anywhere from 6-9 hours per night, you can tell based on if you are tired the next day lol
- Ideally, sleep in a dark place
- Temperature should be cool, regulate temp with multiples layers e.g. blankets
- It's more important to keep wakeup time consistent, and sleep whenever you get tired at night

## Light
- Sunlight immediately upon waking for 10-30 mins is hugely beneficial
  - Don't look directly at the sun obviously, but don't wear sunglasses, and windows block sunlight
- Avoid artifical light after dark if possible, if not, block blue light after dark
  - Blue light keeps you awake during the day, so *don't* block it during daytime
- Viewing sunlight in the evening is beneficial as well
- Bright lights between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. are universally a bad idea for everyone
- Ideally, after sunset, use candles, fire, or dim red lights to see

## Ref
- Andrew Huberman, Ph.D.: Has a great podcast called "Huberman Lab" or something like that, dealing with all things health, specifically sleep, sunlight, etc.
