## Eat enough calories & nutrients
Food fuels the body in the form of chemical energy, measured in calories. Eat as much as your burn, and you'll maintain weight. Eat more, gain weight. Eat less, lose weight. You can tell if you're eating enough by tracking bodyweight.

Food builds the body in the form of nutrients. The reason a thousand different diets exist is because humans naturally want to eat the most rewarding foots -- fatty, salty, sugary stuff. This was helpful for our ancestors, but in the modern day leads to many health problems. The simplest solution is to follow the Mediterranean diet as closely as possible.

Why? The essential nutrients are:
- **Protein**: eat 0.7g/lb of bodyweight
- **Fats**: eat plenty of omega-3 and omega-6 unsaturated fat
- **Fiber**: challenging since there are many types of fiber, simplest solution is to eat lots of plants
- **Vitamins**: challenging, eat lots of plants
- **Minerals**: challenging, eat lots of plants
- **Carbs**: not actually essential, avoid sugar, eat lots of whole grains and plant carbs

Vitamins and minerals are the hardest nutrients for most people to get enough of. Eating a varied diet mostly based on plants ensures that you get enough vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Meat also has lots of vitamins & minerals, but it's high in saturated fat, which leads to other problems like high blood cholesterol.

## Gather whole ingredients
Focus on getting whole ingredients with minimal processing. Processing adds a bunch of ingredients to food that aren't nutrients, like preservatives, extra salt, flavorings, colorings, etc that don't help you out at all. The best ingredients are plants from the ground, ideally grown locally with love, and preferably with minimal pesticides/herbicides/etc.

- **Proteins**: The best sources are *beans* (or other legumes) combined with a whole-grain for a complete amino acid profile. Meat isn't even necessary. Whole-grains like brown rice, oats, whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, etc are good options. Don't get me wrong, meat is also a good option, and I personally love it, but try to stick with poultry and fish (which is also high in omega-6)
- **Fats**: Non-hydrogenated plant oils are the go to option. Extra-virgin olive oil is probably the overall best fat.
- **Fiber, Vitamins, Minerals**: Best option here is to make sure that all of your meals have lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, etc.

**Grocery list**: I find it simplest to make a checklist on my phone and uncheck items when I run out of them at home. This way, the ingredients are like the cooking palette, and each week I buy whatever I'm running low on. If I don't use an ingredient for a while, I tend to remove it from my list. For example, every week I purchase:
- Garlic, Onions (any type), Jalapenos, Tomatoes, Lemon/Limes, Cilantro
