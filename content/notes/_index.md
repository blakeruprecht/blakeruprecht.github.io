Practice everything. If I have to do it, might as well do it well. What's the point of this page? It's just to list my solutions to these daily problems. For me, these are the simplest solutions I can come up with.

## Spirit
- WIP: meditation, mindfulness, love, spirit, purpose, why?

## Relationships
- [**friends**](friends): Close relationships are probably the most important part of life.
- [**partner**](partner): The most important relationship is the person you choose as your partner, in every sense.
- [**community**](community): Local community leads to serenditipitous encounters; Online community leads to jobs?

## Money
- [**income**](income): Jobs, vocations, professions, careers, passions, etc.
- [**budget**](budget): To have more money, increase your income, or increase your savings, both are effective.

## Fitness
- [**exercise**](exercise): It all starts with nose-breathing and proper posture, then barefoot walking, then cardio, and finally muscular training
- [**nutrition**](nutrition): Follow the Mediterranean diet, gather whole ingredients, cook simple meals, eat high protein, drink lots of water. 
- [**recovery**](recovery): Sleep and hygiene are essential for restoring your body back to a healthy baseline (but they don't make you stronger).
- [**tools**](tools): Ideally own nothing, but most people need clothes, backpacks, software, vehicles, and homes. Keep it simple.
