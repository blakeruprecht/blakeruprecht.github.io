These are the references to all of my published work, including some PDFs. For roughly five years, I studied Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a focus on the AI Alignment problem, which I tried to solve by developing mathematical techniques that align AI behavior with human intentions. Generally, my group researched fuzzy logic techniques to build neuro-fuzzy algorithms that could model and reason about concepts, as well as enable human feedback loops to improve the model. Basically, we were trying to create eXplainable AI systems to solve the AI alignment problem. The problem is still unsolved.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! I love discussing this stuff and anything related to XAI, AI Alignment, AI in general, and anything related to learning, cognition, behavior, etc.
