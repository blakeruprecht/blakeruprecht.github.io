- [waterbending](waterbending.md) Where am I? Here. What time is it? Now. What am I? This moment.
- [airbending](airbending.md) The purpose of thinking is action, not thinking. I simplify my thoughts to use only what matters.
- [earthbending](earthbending.md) I love myself so fucking much and my life and my people. So I love others too, and believe that all living matters
- [firebending](firebending.md) Lead, go first, go fast, don't wait to feel ready, for permission, or for approval from others
