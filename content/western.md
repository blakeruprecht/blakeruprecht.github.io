What does being Western even mean?

1. Before recorded history, all humans were hunter-gatherers
2. Horses were tamed around 40,000 BC in Anatolia (modern-day TÃ¼rkiye)
3. The first [[civilization]]s starts up around 10,000 BC
4. Proto-Indo-Europeans spread out around 3,000 BC
	1. Barbarians are always better fighters
	2. Horse-mounted archers crush foot-mounted spear men
5. PIEs setup shop all over modern Europe, in the Middle East, and down into India (hence the Indo-European name)
6. Modern westerners descended from the PIEs

I think modern Westerners are heavily defined by three distinct groups of people that lived over the years. 

First, the Greco-Romans created a dominant civilization starting with the Greeks, enlarged by Alexander, and finally made dominant by the Romans.

During Roman times, a little lad by the name of Jesus got axed and started a whole new religion, whose in-fighting has defined modern Western culture.

And finally, after the fall of the Romans to the Germans, the Germanic peoples just kept churning out new ideas and fighting over land, to the point that they became the most dominant empires in the world after the Renaissance. The Germans, Dutch, and British started to dominate the world, and that has continued into American global hegemony.
