I've worked on the AI Alignment/Safety/Risk/Responsibility problem for five years now. I was a Research Assistant @Mizzou advised by [Derek Anderson](https://derektanderson.com/) and the [Center for Geospatial Intelligence](https://engineering.missouri.edu/research/featured/center-for-geospatial-intelligence-cgi/). In our work, we developed novel neuro-symbolic systems that explain their decision-making steps to improve state of the art object detection performance while enhancing AI alignment/safety/etc.

**What is the problem?** There are many names for the process of creating AIs that don't take over the world and kill us. AI cannot currently harm humans, but it will likely be the most powerful technology humans ever create. The obvious answer to keep us safe is to just not build AI, but this obviously isn't an option. There is no next best option, since nobody has built powerful enough AI yet. All of the techniques to build safer AIs are just the current best guesses, albeit guesses made by very smart people.

**What did I do?** First, I got up to speed with the state of the art in AI -- modern machine learning techniques, deep learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, all of it.

Next, I started working on developing high-performing neural networks with an added layer of fuzzy math on top to represent the decision-making process used by the AI. 

**Did it work?** Yes, I was able to successfully code up new neuro-symbolic models in Python/PyTorch and experiment on simulated and real datasets. We achieved state of the art object detection performance, and improved explainability.

**Is AI Safety solved?** Hell no! All I did was scratch the surface of AI safety, it by no means solves the problem. Does it add one very specific technique that might help? Yup! And at the end of the day, that's a W in science.

**What degree did you get?** I was originally going for my PhD, but stopped about halfway through, so I presented my M.S. thesis and defended it, receiving a Masters of Science. Technically, I did *way* more work than needed for a MS and published a lot of papers, but I'm not a full-fledged scientist yet :)

Here, I've listed the references to my published work. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out (contact info on [my home page](/)).
