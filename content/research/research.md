Previously, I was an Artificial Intelligence research assistant at the University of Missouri (MIZ-ZOU!) working with [Derek Anderson](https://derektanderson.com/) and the [Center for Geospatial Intelligence](https://engineering.missouri.edu/research/featured/center-for-geospatial-intelligence-cgi/). Our work focused on eXplainable AI (XAI), specifically developing new neuro-fuzzy systems.

I researched the AI Alignment problem, which is in the same category as AI safety research, risk research, etc., alignment is the modern term used to describe developing artificial intelligences that have the same goals as humans and are trustworthy and safe to use. eXplainable AI (XAI) is one broad set of techniques used to develop AI systems that explain their reasoning steps using mathematical models. We approached this topic by adding fuzzy math layers on top of existing neural net (NN) models to explain the reasoning of the NNs. This technique did not explain the NN, but can be thought of as adding one layer of explanation on top of the existing NN black-box. Eventually, maybe this research goes in the direction of adding more layers, who knows?

Here, I've listed the references to my published work. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out (contact info on [my home page](/)).
