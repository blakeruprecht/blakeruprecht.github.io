## How to Win Games
1. Play fair. Nobody likes playing with cheaters, and most of your opponents will probably be people from your community that you'll face again. Either way, it's just to play fair and respect the rules.
2. Chill out a bit. Forget about every past failure. Don't worry about future failures. If you want to win, you can't be stressing about winning, just focused on executing the next action to the best of your abilities.
3. Give it your all. Don't forget that slow is smooth and smooth is fast, but get up there and rip it, full send, don't hold back. Have confidence in your shot and always remember, shooters shoot.
