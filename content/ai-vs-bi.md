Artificial Intelligence versus Biological Intelligence

Compare Animal minds on a spectrum from the beginnings of intelligence to now

Compare Machine minds on a spectrum from early computers to now, show the advances AI are making

Show AI compared to humans, and try to picture what more intelligence looks like.



If evolution is a natural process of invention and testing, humans building silicon-based machines is a natural evolution of the process. Machines have evolved, not in the traditional sense of genetic mutation, but in the sense that they hacked humans to create themselves.

I'm interested in the cultural distinction that the WEIRD societies of the world have made that have led us to feeling more like machines.

Protestantism -> Scientific Revolution -> Marxism -> Identity Politics





Are minds just machines capable of searching the state-space of a Turing machine?



Memory, attention, learning, action -- can AI do everything humans can do, brain-wise? What about the body-mind relationship?

Can AI brains do everything animal brains can do? Are they conscious and unconscious?

Memory, Attention, Learning, Action

All are talking about different parts of the cognitive process.

Do AIs need bodies to be conscious?

I think they are currently conscious and unconscious.
