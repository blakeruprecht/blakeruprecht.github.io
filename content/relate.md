Humans are "pack" animals, though we typically use words like "tribe", "group", "team", "family", "clan", "community", etc. Basically, we cannot survive by ourselves, since we need to eat so much food to provide for our big social brains, need to defend ourselves against other humans, and have been doing the relationship thing for so long, that connection is a requirement for most people.
