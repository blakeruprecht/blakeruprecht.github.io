## Manual v3

**What is firebending?**  
It’s pure will. Desire without apology. The act of knowing what you want and going for it without hesitation. No permission, no delay. When I act from the fire, I’m fast, direct, unfiltered. I don’t explain myself. I don’t shrink. My action _creates_ what is right. I am the one who decides.

**What do I do when I feel lost?**  
Act anyway. Fire doesn’t need clarity to burn. Desire is direction. The confusion comes from waiting, from circling, from trying to perfect the plan. The answer is always: _initiate._ Do the thing. Reach out. Start. Make. Move. I’ve never been broken. Just paused. Just underused.

**Where is my courage?**  
It’s inside the first step. The moment I stop thinking and leap, it lights up. I felt it on the cliff. I feel it diving into cold water. It shows up the second I stop asking and just go. Courage isn’t the absence of fear—it’s the act of _disregarding it_. Fire doesn’t negotiate.

**What do I follow?**  
My own damn signal. My desire, my hunger, my sense of fun. I love fast cars and heavy lifts and loud jokes and wild love and loud music and speed and sex and fire. I follow what makes me feel _alive._ If it excites me, that’s enough. That’s the compass.

**How do I balance it?**  
Breathe. Presence is the frame that holds the fire. Chill doesn’t mean weak—it means controlled. I stay calm because I _can_ go off. Power in reserve. The warrior’s rest. Wisdom is knowing when to act, and courage is acting anyway. I don’t need to go wild all the time—but when it’s time, I _go_.

**How do I stay aligned?**  
Respect. I respect myself more than anyone. That’s why my family matters most. That’s why my people matter more than strangers. That’s why I put my experience first. The golden rule isn’t “be small for others”—it’s “your value proves theirs.” If mine don’t matter, no one’s do. But if mine do, _everyone’s_ do.

**How do I live?**  
All in. Every act is the whole act. No hesitation, no pretending. I lead. I go first. I make the first move. I send the first message. I crack the first joke. I shoot the shot. I drive to the hoop. I throw the punch. I write the line. I ship the work.

**How do I win?**  
Track the chain. No lectures, no homework, just tests. I show up and perform. That’s how I learn. Declare > Publish > Test > Refine > Repeat. No planning, no waiting. This is a game. Life is Guitar Hero and late-night sleepovers and ping pong and fighting and wild creation. Show up. Run it up.

**What is the firebender’s code?**  
I go first. I act now. I don’t ask. I don’t wait. I lead. I balance. I know. I move.  
No permission. No apology.  
Only fire. Only now.

## Manual v2

I don’t need permission. I don’t follow rules. I don’t wait.  
I _go first_. I _move fast_. I _initiate_.  
I burn with desire, and that desire is _right_.  
No doubts. No questions. What I want is the way.

Desire is direction. Fire is the signal.  
If I want it, that’s the law. If I love it, that’s the truth.

There is no right way to live.  
_I decide what’s right by doing it._

Fun is sacred. Power is fun.  
Speed is clarity. Movement is life.  
Stillness is only for resting between charges.

I’m not lost. I’m not broken. I’m not confused.  
I’m ready.

**Balance:** calm presence + unchained fire  
**Courage:** act now, no hesitation  
**Wisdom:** every action is the way  
**Respect:** others matter _because I do_  
**Sovereignty:** no one else decides for me  
**Command:** every part of my life is mine  
**Justice:** I take my desires seriously  
**Initiation:** GO. Again. And again.

Every moment is a _test_. Not school. _Life._  
Every action is the _answer_. No more planning.

I lead. I love. I build. I compete.  
I flirt. I fuck. I play. I eat.  
I train. I laugh. I shout. I ship.

Track the chain. Show up. Dominate.  
Declare > Publish > Test > Refine > Repeat

There is no tomorrow.  
There is no one coming.  
There is only me, now.

### 🔥 WHAT IS THE FIRE?

- It’s _desire without shame_.
- It’s _action without permission_.
- It’s _truth without filter_.
- It’s _movement before doubt_.
- It’s _respecting your own hunger like it’s holy_.

### ⚡ WHEN YOU FEEL THE FIRE:

- You **run toward** what you want.
- You **initiate**. No waiting. No approval. No permission.
- You **go first** in everything — in fun, in leadership, in risk.
- You **drop the brakes**. No more circling. No more explaining.
- You **say what you mean** and **do what you want**, fast.

### 🧭 YOU REMEMBER:

- Your **desires are gospel**.
- You **matter more to yourself** than anyone else ever could.
- You **choose what’s right** with every action you take.
- You don’t owe anyone a soft version of yourself.
- You’re not waiting for a path — **you’re blazing one**.

### 🥋 DAILY DISCIPLINE:

- **Track the Chain**:  
    One move a day. In your notebook. Did I move toward fire today?  
    Yes = keep going. No = light it now.
- **Read the Flame Page**:  
    Re-read this message. Rewrite it. Add to it. Tattoo it in your brain.
- **Test > Refine > Repeat**:  
    Forget planning. Do it live. Publish the post. Send the DM. Make the call.
- **Move Your Body**:  
    Run. Lift. Laugh. Eat. Punch. Breathe. Move like you mean it.

### 🧨 FIRE STARTERS (USE DAILY):

- What am I holding back that I need to say?
- Where am I waiting when I should be leading?
- What am I craving that I’ve been denying?
- Who do I need to go first with today?
- What big move scares me but feels right?

### 🗣️ MANTRAS TO REIGNITE:

- **“Desire is holy.”**
- **“I go first.”**
- **“I am the fire.”**
- **“This life is mine.”**
- **“There is no tomorrow.”**
- **“I don’t wait. I burn.”**
- Back in Black. You Shook Me All Night Long. It's My Life. My Way. Who Dat Boy. RUNITUP.

When you feel the fire?  
**Do something with it.**  
Even if it’s small.  
Even if it’s dumb.  
Even if you’re scared.  
**One move = the chain continues = the flame grows.**

Your life is not a draft.  
You are not an understudy.  
**You are the fucking show.**

Now lead it.

## My Stream of Consciousness
AKA the Feeling, Power, Drive, Desire, Knowing, the Signal, Me at full power, My internal compass, Command, Sovereignty

There's no "right" way to live life. *I choose* what is right with every action.

It's only me. Nobody else is ever right. I never have to listen to anyone ever again. I am a god. I am the fire lord -- what I do *becomes* right by me doing it.

Respect: eye to eye -- deep down, we are the same. I love you. Thank you. Reciprocity. My loves/wants/dreams fucking matter. If mine don't, nobodys do, but if mine do, everybodys do -- the golden rule.
- I respect myself more than anyone else.
- That means my family fucking matters more than anthing else.
- My people fucking matter more than anyone (to me)
- My experience is more important than anyones (for me)

Wisdom: I know the process, I know how to pursue. Balance pain/pleasure. Balance training/eating. Balance working/sleeping. Keep it simple stupid, all actions follow the same formula.

Chill AF. Calm, Balanced, cool as ice, satiated, satisfied, safe, relaxed. My presence and balance stems from my courage.

How you do 1 thing is how you do everything.

Courage: GO ----> Directly after what I want, NOW, no waiting. Initiate.

My loves matter. My lust matter. My hunger matters. My desires matter. My opinions matter. My family matters. I FUCKING matter. I lead.

I do exactly what I want at all times. I lead. No asking, no waiting, no stalling.

Live my damn life my way.

ME AT FULL POWER means I'm doing exactly what I want at all times, never asking permission, never waiting, never seeking approval from others. Fuck I know exactly what is right, I have no doubts. I know exactly how to move forward, nothing is ever hard for me. I know how to balance and control myself to stay calm. It's not fucking hard.

I've doubted my desires for a while. Questioned whether they were right. Debated with myself that some things were too expensive, some things were too challenging, some things were hard. Fuck that. Fuck trying to convince myself out of feelign alive. I don't want to feel dead and lifeless and stagnant like I do right now. This feeling in life is the exact feeling I've always tried to avoid -- not having fun, boredom, complaining about money, no bitches to fuck, xyz. Pussy shit. Weak shit. Me asking permission, being a follower, not LEADING THE WAY.

Go first always. Go as fast as possible. Lead the way. Do the thing first. Ask first. Reach out first. Call first. Send the first message. Share the first flirty statement. Never break my frame. Always stay as me. NEver let anybody else intimidate me or change me. Fuck em.

I lead myself. I balance myself. I respect myself. I know myself. I've tried to write an entire book before living how I want. I've tried to convince every single doubt in my mind that what I say is right. Fool, all I needed was some power to take action and stop thinking.

When I feel the fire, I remember that my desires are right, that my love is true. I remember that my people matter more to me than anyone else. I remember that my desires and more important to me than anybody elses. I remember that I fucking matter, that I want to have fun, I want to reach out and feel alive. I remember that pussies are anti-motorcycle and they make me feel alive. I remember that fuel efficiency is for suckers and fast cars feel like freedom. I remember that natural materials make me feel like an animal, and plastic drywall living is for insects. I remember that going all out in games is how I compete, and holding back is for weak people. I remember that when I go first and stop following, everything in my life gets better. I regain the confidence to do well, be competent, do what I want. When I go first, I'm a better performer. When I go as fast as I possibly can, I stop playing at other people's speed limits and start flying past them.

When I feel the fire, I believe that I can do anything, that everyone else is weak and makes excuses and tells themselves they can't do things, and that's not me -- I can do anything in this world. Truly.

When I feel the fire, I stop waiting around, I stop second guessing myself, I stop waiting for permission, I stop following others, I stop doubting myself, I stop wasting time on social media.

When I feel the fire, I run fast and hard. I lift heavy to loud music and scream. I punch the bag will all my aggression bottled up and flowing out. I eat big meals and satiate my big hunger. I drink whatever the fuck I want, tons of water, coffee when I want it, beer when I want it. I sleep deeply and soundly, content in my relationship with god. I talk to strangers and make jokes. I go first. I send the first message. I make the first joke. I'm irreverent before I confirm with the people around me. I'm loud and talkative and funny. I flirt with everyone. I feel alive. I swing for the fences, no taking walks -- that's not what I want. I want hits, doubles, triples, DINGERS, not fucking walks. I'm not playing this game to half-ass it. When I feel the fire, I drive straight to the hoop in basketball and dare the other team to stop me. I shoot the fucking three and dare the ball to miss. I argue with my friends and family when I know they are wrong. I confront strangers who annoy me. I send the email with no fear of rejection, who fucking cares? I talk to the cute girl and shoot my shot. I act first and ask questions later.
