- **Belief that I matter**. If my wants/needs matter more than anybody else, that means we all matter. If I don't matter, that means nobody matters. I know what side I want to be on -- mattering is more fun!
- **Justice = Alignment + Responsibility.** It means aligning your actions with fairness, integrity, and regard for others and the world.
- **Response-ability.** You can’t control what happens to you, only how you respond. That response is your responsibility.
- **Not your fault, still your job.** Life’s pain and randomness aren’t your doing, but how you handle them is up to you.
- **Do something.** Inaction isn't neutral—entropy means standing still is moving backward.
- **Justice is both personal and societal.** Internally: harmony and integrity. Externally: fairness, reciprocity, and contribution to others.
- **The Golden Rule.** Treat others how you wish to be treated. Don’t just seek fairness—enact it.
- **Ownership.** Own your actions, choices, and path. You can't always choose the outcome, but you can always choose your next step.
- **Willpower over fate.** Timshel ("thou mayest") means you _can_ choose. Maktoub ("it is written") means the path exists, but you still walk it.
- **Sportsmanship** is playing by the rules so that everyone can have fun and test their skills.
