I don't know much about fighting, but I do know it's the ultimate expression of athletic prowess -- defending what you love. Luckily in modern civilization, fighting is mostly unnecessary, and mainly reserved for professional soldiers and criminals.

Striking
- Hands: Boxing, Karate
- Feet: Kickboxing, Karate
- Elbows/Knees: Muay Thai

Wrestling
- Olypmic Wrestling

Grappling
- Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

Weapons
- Knife fighting: skip this
- Sword fighting: might as well learn spears while you're at it
- Archery: old school, but Catniss proves its utility
- Shooting: pistols and shotguns are hard and fun, rifles are super easy to shoot
