AKA wise, prudent, discerning

- **Keep it simple stupid.** The fastest way to go from A to B is a straight line.
- **Minimal**. If minimum wasn't good enough, it wouldn't be the minimum.
- **Do less, but better.** Commit to as little as possible, keep it light -- but what you do commit to, go all in
- **Adaptability is key.** It's not the strongest, the fastest, the smartest, the bravest, or the nicest animal that survives -- it's the one most adaptable to change.
	- **Principle of Least Commitment**: don't commit to any identity, belief, or piece of knowledge if you don't have to. This helps you stay adaptable.
	- **Minimal identity**: My name is Blake, I'm a living being just like you.
- **Paradox and humor are signs of wisdom.**
- **Wisdom isn't certainty.** It's the humility of “I know that I know nothing.”
- **Updating beliefs to new evidence.**
