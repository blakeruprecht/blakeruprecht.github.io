**Hand made**. I coded this website by hand using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (the basics). The content is managed by a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that converts markdown (.md) files to HTML (.html). Over time, I've added and removed many features of this site, like navigation menus, day/night mode, etc., but I like clean websites. Email me if you want to argue this!

**Minimal design**. Grayscale, minimal, and using the font NotoSans so that "AI" looks like two uppercase letters and not the name Al.

**Free and open source**. The source code of this website is freely and openly availably at [this Github Repo](https://github.com/blakeruprecht/blakeruprecht.github.io) under the MIT license. [Free and Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (FOSS) is punk, anti-capitalist, anti-ownership, anti-privatiziation, pro-freedom, pro-sharing economy, post-scarcity, and pro commons-based peer production.

**Github Pages hosting**. I host this website for free on Github as part of their Github Pages service, which enables anybody with an account to host one website for free. Pretty sweet!

**Squarespace domain**. I got the domain from Squarespace Domains (formerly Google), and hooked it up to Github Pages using DNS records.

**Test HTML/CSS**. This is also where I test my web design, so ignore everything else below this line!

Follow by a lovely quote.

> "If minimum wasn't good enough, it wouldn't be the minimum."

And just to round it out, some `code` and LaTex inline $y=x^2$ and centered
$$1 = 0.999999999\ldots$$
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\log{xy} = \log{x} + \log{y}$$
$$\frac{d{f}}{d{t}} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}$$
$$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$
$$i^2 = -1$$
$$\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$
$$\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a)$$
$$d(S) \geq 0$$
$$H = -\sum{p(x) \log(p(x))}$$
