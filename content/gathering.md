## Keep an enduring list
I keep one Grocery List on my phone in the notes app, with checkboxes enabled. This way at the store, I check off everything I buy. During the week, whenever I run out of an ingredient, I uncheck that item on my phone list. This way, I always have a list I'm updating, and anytime I happen to enter into a grocery store, I can pull out my phone and know exactly what I need at that moment (or at least have a good guess).

## My Ingredient List
I eat mostly whole foods and stick to the ingredients I like, which are usually these:

MEAT & DAIRY
- Chicken Thigh or Breast
- Ground Beef (or Fish or something else)
- Greek Yogurt, whole milk
- Milk, whole, vitamin D
- Cheese, typically shredded or cream

CARBS / FATS / AISLES
- Oats, old-fashioned
- Peanut Butter
- Rice, usually white
- Pasta, usually spaghetti and rigatoni
- Beans, usually black and pinto
- Fresh Bread, usually tortillas, buns, or sourdough
- Fresh Olives, if I can find them for cheap...

FRESH PRODUCE
- Bananas
- Berry Medley, frozen
- Apples / Grapes / Oranges (lunch options)
- Carrots / Bell Peppers (lunch options)
- Garlic
- Onion
- Chili, usually jalapenos
- Lemon / Lime / both
