Same as living at home. You need a few basic amenities:

- Clothes to keep you warm and protected
- A place to sleep (e.g. Sleeping Pad with a Sleeping Bag in a Tent or Car)
- A water source, a water filter, and a water storage container
- Food to eat, and maybe a pot/pan to cook food with
- Utility tools like a knife, fire starters, light sources, navigation, etc.
