"He" just looks different nowadays after the fall of organized religion (at least within educated circles).


Nobody uses swords anymore, but I'm not talking about sharp metal sticks used to stab and slash. I'm talking about another type of sword -- the sword of meditation.

I've struggled with overthinking my whole life, and the only thing that has finally cut through all the crap is this:

- Don't try to untangle the messy web of thoughts in your brain. Slash through them with the sword of meditation, sending the threads tumbling away.


- Grit, resilience, mental strength?

- [[Tao and zen are sick]]
- [[Action]]
- [[Slash your thoughts, Blank slate, First principles, Start from scratch, Sketchbook theory]] -- my homage to zen
	- *Peaceful Warrior* by Dan Millman
	- *How to Sit* by Thich Nhat Hahn
	- *The Happiness Hypothesis*, by Jonathan Haidt, H=S+C+V
	- The first realization is that you are alive, and as a living, breathing human being, you must survive.
	- You realize that there is no steady-state maintenance in life, since everything keeps changing.
	- There's either growth/living, or entropy/dying.
	- Inaction is a slow death.
	- Zen/breathing meditation is the action of inaction
- [[Life is a single-player game]] -- my homage to nihilism
	- There is no god
	- Stoicism -- what can you control?
	- Taoism -- go with the flow, design your own values for life, don't let others tell you how to live. It's 100% up to you, fuck everyone else. You choose. It's your power.
	- Flow -- the psych concept
	- Make life into a game, you design the rules, you build the environments, you collect coins (see what I'm doing, making an analogy to make real life seem as epic as the coolest things in life -- sports/games/war (not so much war, but it used to be cool))
	- Why game theory/RL is such a useful reference point
- [[Discipline equals freedom]] -- how to win games
	- *Discipline Equals Freedom* by Jocko Willink
		- It starts with loving the people you lead
		- From there, you'll do everything you can to win, not to be right/true/etc.
	- The Process by Nick Saban
		- It starts with the love to commit 100%
	- Growth Mindset
	- Leave it all on the field
	- Game theory
		- Infinite repeated games
	- Reinforcement learning (RL)
		- All that matters is winning if you choose to play
	- Grinding -- what hard experience teaches is that there is no replacement for displacement -- time spent grinding
- [[Love means paying attention]] -- my homage to love
	- When we live life from a first principles approach, slashing out all of the useless shit and only adding back in that which truly serves us from all angles of our lives -- it helps us survive, we love to experience the action, we steadily improve at the action, then our lives become expressions of love because our actions align with our priorities.
	- If we care enough to do an action...
	- And we care enough to fully pay attention and experience the action in a flow state (like play)...
	- And we care enough to grow our abilities
	- Then we prove that our actions are infused with love from the ground up: survival, play, growth, love.




Love means paying attention

How you do one thing is how you do everything.

Breathe in, breathe out.

There is no path to peace, peace is the path.




Focusing on the present moment is pretty much the biggest performance hack of all time. Relax, let go of the outcome, try your absolute hardest, who cares about the result. Whatever keeps you focused on the present moment (living) versus thinking about the past/future (inaction/dying).

This is the Process, Growth Mindset, whatever you want to call it.

- Meditation is the art of breathing (non-action is false, we're still breathing)
- CBT is the most effective type of therapy, related to journaling, etc.
- Medication is a great solution to those with altered brain chemistry

SPIRIT / MINDSET / GOALS / THOUGHTS / PLAN / MAP / RATIONALITY
- **Zen** - Start from first principles in everything by using Zen meditation to slash all of your thoughts to control your mind. Most people are controlled by their thoughts, but with training, you can teach yourself to control your mind. This way, you can ignore everybody else and all of the noise being spouted at your by advertising, the media, propaganda, idiots, etc. Why? Well, you'll eventually figure out that meditation is the hack for discovering the truth about the world, but for now, just trust that all of the thoughts we have previously held in our heads need to be thrown out to make room for growth.
	- First Principles
	- Keep it simple, stupid
	- Non-action (really the act of breathing)
	- e.g. *Discipline Equals Freedom* (Jocko), *How to Sit* (Hahn), etc.
- **Tao** - realize that there is no external goal (God is dead, religion is dead) and reality is a process to experience (Jamis), so you may as well find a way to enjoy it and go along with the flow like the Taoists!
	- Common sense is probably correct, traditions are probably correct, but none of these are mandatory. Don't listen to anybody else.
- **Play** - all of the things on this list can be thought of as play, or *flow* activities
	- *"Work and play are words used to describe the same things under different circumstances."* -Mark Twain
		- It's never about "winning", because that's a finite state in time (a state-action space that you want to get to), and then you are immediately gone again, similar to Saban's idea of the process, it never stops
		- It's about "playing", which means taking action over and over again to improve, chase goals, have fun, or suffer, whatever you want to call it. Living.
		- Like Camus, the ultimate goal of life is to just experience it.
	- Minimax life -- to optimize for anything, you have to figure out how to minimize everything else. Let's say you want to become a great Chef -- you still have to build relationships, earn resources, breathe, bathe, eat, exercise, etc. You can potentially combine "cooking" and "resource gathering" once you get good, but until then, you'll have to do all of these. It's then extremely useful to understand how to minimize all of the other categories so you can maximize cooking.
		- Here's the thing -- everyone will define different minimums for themselves. I've defined them for myself this way.
