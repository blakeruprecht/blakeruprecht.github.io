- **Drink when you're thirsty.** There's no official recommendation for volume since every bodies hydration needs are different based on age, local temperature and humidity, activity levels, how much you sweat, and more factors.
- **Water Bottle**. Carry one around with you to drink more water throughout the day.
- **32 oz/hour**. That's roughly a liter per hour, around the max a person can absorb in one hour. If your pee is clear, you are just expelling water that your body isn't using.
