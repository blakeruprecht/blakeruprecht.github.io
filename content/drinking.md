- **WHO**: me
- **WHEN**: all day
- **WHERE**: everywhere
- **HOW**:
	0. Get a water bottle to carry around
	1. Drink 32/oz of **WATER** per hour or less, based on need
	2. Drink [coffee](/coffee) in moderation
	3. Drink [beer](/beer) in moderation

## Why
- **Water is an essential [macronutrient](/eating-macronutrients).** It's *the* essential macronutrient, the body requires a constant intake of water to replace all the water lost from living.
- **Drink when you're thirsty.** There's no official recommendation for volume since every bodies hydration needs are different based on age, local temperature and humidity, activity levels, how much you sweat, and more factors.
- **Water Bottle**. Carry one around with you to drink more water throughout the day.
- **32 oz/hour**. That's roughly a liter per hour, around the max a person can absorb in one hour. If your pee is clear, you are just expelling water that your body isn't using.
