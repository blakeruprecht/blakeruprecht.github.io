Useful for warmth, weather protection, and social conformity.

## Eyes/Head/Hands
- **Sunglasses** - To [protect my eyes](/cleaning) from UV sunlight rays
- **Ballcap/Brimmer** - A hat with a brim to shield my face from the sun, a full-brim is useful for being outside all day.
- **Beanie** - A warm hat for winter since my hair is short.
- **Gloves** - Warm gloves for winter for my hands.

## Layers
- **Rain Shell** - Outerlayer, mainly protects against rain, provides lots of warmth.
- **Fleece Jacket** - Midlayer for warmth during active movement.
- **Puffer Coat** - Midlayer for warmth when chilling, or layering over the fleece.
- *Blazer* - A specific type of nice fitted jacket for formal events.

## Shoes
