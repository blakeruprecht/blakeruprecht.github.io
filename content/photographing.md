Photography is very similar to [drawing](/drawing), in the sense that it teaches you to notice lighting, composition, shapes, and colors.

Photography reminds me of painting with it's emphasis on color and light, playing with those interactions across a scene.

- **Lighting** - How do you represent pitch darkness and sunlight brightness?
- **Composition** - Where are the objects in the frame?
- **Shapes** - What angle do you have on the objects?
- **Colors** - What colors pop, which are muted?
