I'm a [computer science master](/research), so take these recommendations with a grain of salt. I've installed many different OSes, built my own computer, revived long-dormant old laptops, hand-built my own website, and coded in many different languages.

Here's my current computer setup:
- [Hardware](/computer-hardware): Dell XPS 13 9370 laptop, iPhone 13 Mini smartphone
- [Operating System](os.md): Debian Linux (laptop), iOS 18 (phone)
- Programs: [terminal](terminal.md), Firefox browser, Brave browser, Obsidian text editor, VSCode text editor, Cursor text editor, GIMP image editor, Zathura pdf viewer, Discord messaging
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (default for [websites](/websites)), [Python](/python) (default on all Linux/MacOS machines), Go (for the Hugo SSG)

I also have a smartphone (iPhone 13 Mini) running iOS 18 which I don't use for any real computing.
