I have beer in my blood. I'm from STL, the city in the US with the best brewing tradition (in my very biased opinion). I love drinking beer with my best buds and my family.

A book I read recently (*Drunk* by Edward Slingerland) makes a fascinating argument that alcohol was basically the reason humans settled down to start farming, since alcohol improves human creativity by lowering inhibitions, leading to better cooperation due to trust derived from drinking rituals, enabling humans to build larger and more successful communities.

> "A poet once said, *'The whole universe is in a glass of [beer].'* We will probably never know in what sense he said that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look in glass of [beer] closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of the stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the [beer]? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in [beer] is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of [beer] without discovering the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of [beer], this universe, into parts — physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on — remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let us give one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!
