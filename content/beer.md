I have beer in my blood. I'm from STL, the city in the US with the best brewing tradition (in my very biased opinion). I love drinking beer with my best buds and my family.

A book I read recently (*Drunk* by Edward Slingerland) makes a fascinating argument that alcohol was basically the reason humans settled down to start farming, since alcohol improves human creativity by lowering inhibitions, leading to better cooperation due to trust derived from drinking rituals, enabling humans to build larger and more successful communities.
