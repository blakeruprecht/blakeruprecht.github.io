title: Nature rewards rationality
description: '"A broad overview of the benefits of intelligence, and how it is the best strategy to win at life."'

Science, rationality, the art of winning -- call it whatever you want, I don't really care about the name. The whole point is that most people don't understand the point of science.

All of these laws, and rules, and difficult math equations -- why? Why should I listen to a scientist instead of my cousin on social media?

Because science is the art of problem solving.

It's not the art of being righteous, or sounding cool, or even having fun. Often, science is extremely slow, methodical, and boring. It takes decades to make progress, and contributions are measured atomically by submitting papers -- literally one tiny idea at a time.




To be rational is not to be truthful, it's to win.

Atomization, the beginnings of rational thought, and how this has increased human intelligence in the long-term -- leading to moon landings, computers, jet travel, and now AI.

## Irrational desires fuel rational learning
Science was basically an accident -- the result of a fuck ton of trial and error. It wasn't some grand plan, or well thought out process. It was just the inevitable result of 100 billion people trying stuff, passing down stories verbally, eventually drawing pictures on tablets, writing books, and enough people read and thought about this stuff to start filling in the gaps everywhere. And there are plenty of gaps.

Why does it work so damn well?
