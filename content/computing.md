Layers of abstraction that extend human thinking. Binary at the bottom, human language at the top, and code fills in all the gaps.

**Software layers**:
1. Hardware -- has code to make each piece run
2. [Operating System](/operating-system) -- interfaces between hardware and programs
3. Programs -- code that the OS runs on hardware
4. Languages -- allow you to rewrite programs

**Basic troubleshooting:**
- Turn it off and on again
- Check if it's plugged in

**Core activities:**
- Navigate files (terminal/file explorer)
- Edit text (code editors)
- Browse internet (browsers)
- Run programs (terminal/applications)
