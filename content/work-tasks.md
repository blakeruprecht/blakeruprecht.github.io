- [ ] [Work](/working) for Amazon
	- Use anger as fuel, not self-punishment. Set the tone in every room. Lead. Initiate. Approach. Move. I am the gravity, moving. Not potential. Treat this work like monk labor -- silent, physical, productive. Fuel the system, fund the writing, get conditioned to hard work.
- [ ] [Write](/writing) my website for my Tribe
	- Website is the base. Notes are supply crates. Begin conquest target by target, word by word. Keep score. Track output. Make the work undeniable. Focus on signal integrity, not reward. Campaign starts now. Write. Ship. Repeat. Execute or decay. Fire doesn't tolerate idle hands.

# Mission

I want to be a writer. I simplify complexity. I teach, write, and build tools that help people think clearly and act decisively.

## Realizations

My problem isn't laziness or lack of potential—it's being an un-deployed weapon. I'm operating in diagnostic mode with high clarity but low output. The pain I feel is stored voltage, not weakness. The solution is a structured campaign: *daily fire applied toward conquest.*

I'm not just trying to earn a living. I'm trying to live by the word. I won't feel peace until my output matches my internal fire.

I reject institutions that flatten people. I reject sales-driven business culture. I reject coaching-as-script, content-as-funnel, teaching-as-obedience. I want full-force, undistorted transmission of ideas that matter to people who are ready.

I'm dominance restrained by empathy. I'm clarity dulled by context. I'm fire tamed by reflection. The cure isn't balance—it's command. I need final, irrevocable permission to act without compromise.

Attraction adds weight because I withhold my full self when stakes feel high. I edit, posture, freeze. Not from weakness, but from misalignment. The move is no exceptions—charm, clarity, fire on tap for everyone.

I trust myself 100%. The people I trust at 0.9+ level: Biggs, Dad, Mom, James, Brems, Scov, Kylie, Kirstie, Tommy, Adam.
