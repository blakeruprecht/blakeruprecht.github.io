- [ ] applying to part-time jobs
	- **Delivery Driver** - already doing it!
	- **Online Tutoring** - Immediately start on Wyzant, Varsity Tutors, Chegg Tutors. For math, computer science, AI concepts, science. My research background qualifies me immediately.
	- **AI Customer Support training**
	- **Science communication** - Science museums, NASA, NOAA, etc
	- **Technical Training Development** - Create courses for Udemy, Skillshare, or corporate. AI explainers, methods, frameworks, etc.
	- **Freelance Technical Education** - Many companies need one-off training sessions for AI adoption, data analysis, research methods
- [ ] build [consulting](/consulting) job
	- **Problem** - I'm not getting what I want out of life. I've stalled professionally because I suppressed my directness, overcompensating for previous relationship damage. I overcorrected from aliveness to analysis paralysis. So I'm now "bad" at working, which mainly means I'm not being courageous enough to create what I want at the moment. I'm good at every other task of [living](/living) except this one.
	- **Solution** - Remote Consulting for income generation. It unlocks nomadism, geographic control, complete autonomy, freedom. No alternative paths have been acceptable to my brain, I've tried -- science researcher, digital marketer, teacher, technical writer, ai customer support, etc.
	- **Stop non-essential activities**. Channel all hours into consulting business development -- draft pitches, send emails, schedule calls, treat rejection as market data. Redirect warrior energy from people (relationship damange) to obstacles (income generation). Business requires confrontational energy -- aim it at market resistance, not individuals.
