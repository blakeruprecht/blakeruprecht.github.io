In today's language, building a [computer](/computer) really means assembling a few pieces together like a LEGO set. It's that easy.

What's hard is picking parts that are actually compatible. For that, use an online tool like [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) to check compatibility, and manually check compatability between every piece as well.

There are four components that determine the performance of a computer:
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** - The main brain of the computer.
- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** - A CPU-spinoff that processes simple math problems (linear equations) extremely well. Good for video games and image processing, some computers have integrated graphics as a part of the CPU.
- **RAM** - Random-access memory, used for storing all the programs that are currently running. Limits how much you can do at one time.
- **Storage/SSD/HDD** - The main memory storage of a computer, used for storing files, data, programs, etc.

And there are three components that support the others:
- **Motherboard** - A circuit board with attachment slots for the CPU, GPU, RAM, and Storage, as well as connections for the Power Supply. It basically routes power to all the components.
	- Essential: the CPU and the Motherboard must have the same socket type.
- **Power Supply (PSU)**: Plugs into a wall outlet and converts 120/240V current into current usable by each component of the PC. Must be able to supply more power than what the other components will use, so that you don't short circuit your CPU/GPU/RAM/Storage/Motherboard.
- **Case**: Technically not even necessary, the case just holds all the other components suspended in the air so that they can get more air flow.
