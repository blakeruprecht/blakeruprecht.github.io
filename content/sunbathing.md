title: Sunbathe early and often to maintain sleep schedule
---
View sunlight upon waking for 10 minutes (30 if it's overcast) to set your circadian rhythym, the bodies natural process to determine when to get tired and when to stay alert.

View sunlight as much as possible throughout the day to keep yourself awake.

View sunlight right before sunset to help tell the body to start winding down for the evening.

Avoid viewing any bright lights after sundown if possible, and especially after 9pm when you're ready to go to sleep.

- Breathe fresh air
- Walk on dirt, sand, rocks, stones
- Swim and feel fresh water
- Enjoy the plants and animals (life) around me
