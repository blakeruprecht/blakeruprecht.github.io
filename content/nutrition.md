- Eat as many calories as you burn each day, a TDEE Calculator can help you figure this out. Otherwise, a scale will tell you if you're storing energy (gaining weight) or losing energy (losing weight).
- Eat protein, close to 0.7-1 gram per pound of bodyweight if you're exercising.
- Drink as much water as you are thirsty for each day.
- Follow the Mediterranean diet. Why? On top of caloric energy, humans need five macronutrients (proteins, fats, fiber, water) and a ton of micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) to survive, because the human body is made of proteins, vitamins, etc. and doesn't have a factory for producing that stuff, so we need to eat it.
- The Mediterranean diet places heavy emphasis on eating tons of whole, locally-grown Vegetables, Fruits, Nuts, Seeds, Beans, and Whole Grains, which are all great sources of vitamins, minerals, etc.
- Meat is great to eat from a nutrition standpoint. People used to hate red meat, but that was dumb, it won't hurt you.
