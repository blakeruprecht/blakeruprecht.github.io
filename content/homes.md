Apartments, townhouses, small houses -- typically less than 600 sqft for 1 person, a bit more per added person. Bigger than the dorm room I lived in, slightly smaller than the two houses I've rented. It's what I would call the "average" home size that most people would reasonably expect to live in -- one that has a kitchen for cooking, a private bathroom, some type of bedroom or bed area, and space for living -- seating, mainly, like tables and chairs and couches.

That's not to mention the basic fact of a home that nobody ever seems to mention -- modern homes are fundamentally machines -- they run on electric, gas, and/or biomass power sources. They have conduits running throughout the walls, transferring water through metal pipes, moving electricity through metal wires protected by plastic sheathing

## Engineering Principles
Small homes cost less to heat and cool.
The electrical and plumbing is cheaper to install.
Is costs less to furnish a small home.
