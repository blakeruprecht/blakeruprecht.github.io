title: '"Build home, work, and third places"'

The two most important environments in most people's lives are their **home** and **workplace**. Since [labor](working.md) is the predominant form of income generation for most people nowadays, [travel](/traveling) is also mainly concerned with traveling between home and work.

## Good Homes
A home is defined as the place you live, the locationg you return to mainly to [sleep](/sleeping), [clean yourself](/cleaning), [get dressed](backpack.md), [eat](/eating), [drink](/drinking) and chill out. I'm calling any place I live a "home", and that could include apartments, condos, townhouses, duplexes, houses, barns, etc.

Modern homes consist of the following structures:
- **Foundation**. Usually a flat concrete slab and any other structurual components that support the weight of the entire house and everything inside of it.
- **Roof and Walls**. Usually made from timber sticks (2x4s), cinder blocks, concrete, bricks, etc.
- **Air flow**. Openings in the roof and walls that allow air to pass through are necessary. Includes things like windows and doors, and any heating and cooling systems installed in the house.
	- **Cooling/HVAC**. A system of conduits (big pipes) that run throughout the house, transporting cold air from the exterior cooling unit into the house, and warm air from the house out of the house.
	- **Heating**. The most common around the world is biofuel (wood stoves), gas and coal are other options for heating systems that pump hot air into the house, and cold air out of the house.
- **Plumbing**. Mainly for sinks, toilets, showers, and laundry machines. A series of pipes, fittings, nozzles, and more than transport fresh water into the house, and grey/black water out of the house. Usually requires a professional Plumber to get this right and up to code.
- **Electric**. Mainly for lightbulbs and appliances. A series of wires that run from public electrical lines to the house, through the main switchboard, and to little lines running all over the house to outlets. Usually requires a professional Electrician to install and ensure code compliance.
- **Appliances**. Sinks, toilets, showers, laundry machines, refrigerators, stoves, and anything else that is fixed into a certain position in the house due to the presence of plumbing and electrical outlets.

Go [small](/minimum). Small homes cost less to heat and cool. The electrical and plumbing is cheaper to install. It costs less to furnish a small home.

### Location, location, location
By far the most important factor for choosing a home -- where is it? Reduce your daily [commute time](/traveling) by minimizing the distance between home and workplace. Increase the opportunity to do fun things by living next to fun things: cool restaurants and bars, national and state parks, water access, etc.

## Good Workplaces
There's not much you can do about improving your workplaces besides changing [jobs](working.md). Some people work from home nowadays, and I have years of experience doing that, and I don't like how there's no separation of concerns between home and workplace -- it all starts to blend together.

## Third Places
Any place you go to hangout besides home and work. Modern culture is seeing a decline in shared third places as people turn towards digital entertainment.
