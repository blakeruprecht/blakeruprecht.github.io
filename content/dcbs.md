## About
- **Quantity**: This makes a ton of hot sauce, like a big pots worth.

- **Flavor**: This is a spicy hot sauce that pretty much goes on anything. The dominant flavor is habanero, which is my favorite chile pepper flavor. The cashews add some creaminess, and the vinegar and other ingredients balance out the flavor, adding acidity and sweetness.

- **Name**: It was originally called Delicious Creamy Bro Sauce, hence DCBS, but honestly, the first name is pretty cumbersome to say.

- **Origins**: Originally invented by James S. Further iterated upon by Nick B.
