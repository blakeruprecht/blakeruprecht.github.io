Welcome to my blog. Life is confusing, hard, and seemingly pointless.
I intend to discuss that in agonizing detail, over and over until I get it right.
We may be here for a while.

## Contact
I love to learn, write, and teach. I'm currently seeking a sales job
in the AI industry, specifically focusing on LLMs and Generative AI.
I hold a Masters degree in the subject, and am not afraid to use it!

## FAQ
> How do I pronounce your name?

My high school teacher said "Roop-ruh-shay", which is hilariously lovely.
Technically, it comes from the Old High German "Hrothi-bert" (same as Robert) meaning bright flame.
So it's pronounced "Roo-pwrecked".
