Hey, I'm Blake. I write clear, human content that helps people and companies communicate better. From website copy to long-form guides, I make ideas easy to understand and fun to learn. My quick [resume](/cv).

I can help with:
- Explaining complex ideas through essays, tutorials, speaking, and more.
- Website and landing page copywriting
- Web development, technical SEO, and content strategy
- AI understanding (I used to be an [AI Safety Researcher](/research))

## Example Writing
- [Civilization Outcompetes Freedom](/civilization): A brief discussion of civilization versus barbarism and which one inevitably wins. Hint, it's the farmers.
- [Develop a Growth Mindset](/growth-mindset): A quick personal reminder of how to focus on growth over perfectionism.
- [Insects are Sustainable Protein](/insect-farming): I've eaten them, should you? They won't replace chicken in my diet, but the future could be weird.
- [What My AI Safety Research Taught Me](/research): I did battle with the robots and lost. Or maybe I won. So what did I learn?
- Read more finished essays at my [archive](/archive).
