I am a writer/researcher from Missouri, currently in Colorado.
- I write a [blog](/blog)
- I previously [researched](/research) safe AI @Mizzou
- I code, mainly HTML/CSS/JS for [this site](https://github.com/blakeruprecht/blakeruprecht.github.io) (it's free and open-source, punk!)

**Hire me**. I'm focused on learning as much as I can about the "*Art of Communicating*", and I play for money, so let's work together.

In other areas of life, I'm passionate about:
- **Art**: My [drawing](/drawing) and [woodworking](/woodwork).
- **Reading**: Obviously, here are a few blog recs: [mnmlist.com](https://mnmlist.com), [Zen Habits](https://zenhabits.com), [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com), [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com), [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net), [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/)
- **Nature**: Getting outside (disc golf, softball, backpacking, fishing), sustainable living, [simple lifestyles](https://mnmlist.com/brew/), and respect for nature (ala [*Braiding Sweetgrass*](https://www.robinwallkimmerer.com/books) by Robin Wall Kimmerer, one of my heros). Eventually I'll write more about [simple living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living), [K.I.S.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [deep ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_ecology), and [solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk), but for now, check out these wikipedia links.
- **Local Community**: One of the best parts of being human is serendipitous encounters with people you know and love. Most of my best friends and I all live on the same block -- we call it the "Barn" ([Tal Raviv explains](https://speakerdeck.com/talraviv/more-constraints-please) why this is great).
- **Rationality**: Science is the art of winning games, it is extremely powerful and can help you [Win at Life](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-science-of-winning-at-life-sequence), but rationality/science/philosophy eventually ends in paradox ([Ryan Simonelli](https://absoluteirony.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/talking-in-circles-20161.pdf) explains why).
- **Math**: [Lockhart's Lament](/https://worrydream.com/refs/Lockhart_2002_-_A_Mathematician's_Lament.pdf) explains the artistry of math, [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) demonstrates the power of abstraction, and [Janna Levin](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/16/life-on-a-mobius-janna-levin-moth/) talks poetically about the odds of finding love (*p*(love)=?).
- **Outlaw music** inspired by outlaw country, classic rock, hippies and cowboys, etc. Exempli gratia: Zach Bryan, Matt Maeson, Morgan Wallen, Tyler Childers, Koe Wetzl, AC/DC, Muscadine Bloodline, and many many others.
- **Craft beer**, especially [Logboat](https://www.logboatbrewing.com/) (Columbia, MO) and [Cherry Street](https://cherrystreetbrewing.com/) (Cumming, GA). I'm a sucker for a good Oktoberfest, Vienna Lager, Rauchbier, Sour, and all the other beauties that I don't feel like listing.
- **Spicy food**: I love cooking, I make [DCBS](/blog/dcbs) and I love all things jalapeno, habanero, carolina reaper, and pepper X.
