Hi, I'm Blake, Welcome to my website! 

Previously I was a Safe Artificial Intelligence [researcher](research) at Mizzou (MIZ!). I have an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering -- I like robots, but I think there's a chance they destroy us all. It's a tricky situation.

I write about AI and other topics on my [blog](blog), here are a few selected articles:
- [How to Install Python](blog/how-to-python)
- [How to Get Better Responses from ChatGPT by Working Backwards](blog/chatgpt-work-backwards)
- [Pay Close Attention to Compatibility When Building a Computer](blog/build-a-computer)

Check out my research, blog, and more up top. Please send me your thoughts through the links below, I would love to hear from you!
