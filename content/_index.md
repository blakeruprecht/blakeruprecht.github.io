## Hi, I'm Blake

![headshot](/headshot.jpg)

I'm currently learning about open-source AI, practical science, and nature.

Some samples of my writing can be found in the [notes](/notes) section of this website, which includes [some](/notes/build-your-own-computer) [samples](/notes/insect-farming) [of](/notes/python) [content](/notes/growth-mindset) writing across domains and a lot of notes about AI/computers.

Previously I [researched](/research) safe artificial intelligence @Mizzou. During this time, I published five scientific articles in international venues. You may not know, but communication is just as important to the scientific process as research, so this experience taught me a ton about efficient and persuasive writing.

I'm new to making websites, but I love coding, so I made this one using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git/Github, and the Hugo static site generator (like WordPress but faster and more coding). The source code for this site lives at [this Github repo](https://github.com/blakeruprecht/blakeruprecht.github.io) (it's free and open-source, punk!). Web design is the digital version of [woodworking](/woodwork) -- it's all boxes!

Offline, you can find me playing in the great outdoors, cooking [spicy](/notes/dcbs) food, drinking good beer, and hanging out with my friends and family. Send me an email, I would love to hear from you!
