# About

<!-- {{< figure

I am a writer and computer scientist based in Colorado. I'm broadly interested in science, history, artificial intelligence, simple living, and staying human in an increasingly machine world.

Since high school, I've earned my BSc in Mechanical Engineering, my MSc in Computer Science (both from Mizzou). I've worked as a Digital Marketer, AI Researcher, and Freelance Writer.
