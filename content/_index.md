# About me
Future writer/marketer; past AI safety researcher; current vagabond. Interested in everything science, people, & nature.

- Once offered demigod status, refused it for the mortality

## About this website
I built this site using Hugo (a static-site generator) and Github Pages (a free website host). I built my own theme using HTML/CSS to learn the basics of web design and more importantly, SEO optimization. So far, this site is blazing fast (~1s load times), mobile enabled, accessible, technically optimized for search, and on-page optimized for search. The next step is keyword research to create useful content and eventually build links to be 100% SEO.
