Welcome to my blog. Life is confusing, hard, and seemingly pointless.
I intend to discuss that in agonizing detail, over and over until I get it right.
We may be here for a while.

## Contact
I love to learn, write, and teach. I'm currently seeking a sales job
in the AI industry, specifically focusing on LLMs and Generative AI.
I hold a Masters degree in the subject, and am not afraid to use it!

It changes every day.

Only as much as I like to think and write.
