Hola! What's up fellow humans? No AIs allowed! I think a lot (some say too much) about AIs and the future of our technology, and am very curious about the reliability of the internet moving forward. Suffice it to say, you'll just have to take my word for it that this website is legit. I mean, c'mon, look at the total lack of ads, buzzwords, silly titles, and general commercial features! I coded this all up myself, and let me tell you, designing HTML/CSS is almost harder than designing ML algorithms. Almost.

Anyways, if you're interested in hiring me, check out my [AI/ML research](/research) page and some of my [blog posts](/blog) about science. Of course, check out the other stuff too.

If you're a friend stopping by, hey, I love you!

Either way, please **email me** your thoughts. I love constructive feedback and really, really, really want to get better at the things I care about.
