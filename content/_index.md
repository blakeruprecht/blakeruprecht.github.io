## About this website
I built this site using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. I write custom HTML and CSS for this site to learn the basics of web design and search engine optimization. This site is blazing fast (~1s load times), designed mobile-first, accessible, technically optimized, and on-page optimized. I host it on Github Pages, and use Github Actions to deploy the site locally from the command line.
