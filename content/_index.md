# Hi, I'm Blake
I write stuff to help people understand ideas.

I write documentation, essays, tutorials, copy, newsletters, and web pages. I manage content end-to-end, writing docs-as-code, simple websites, and technical SEO. I have a BS in MechE and a MS in CompSci, and can explain technical concepts, especially AI. 

Now seeking technical writing/support roles. My public [resume](/cv-Blake-Ruprecht.pdf).

Example writing:
- [What My AI Safety Research Taught Me](/research)
- [Growth Mindset](/growth-mindset)
- [Civilizations Outcompete Barbarians](/civilization)
- [Python](/python)
- My unstructured notes at my [archive](/archive)

Reach out anytime. I would love to hear from you!
