Check out the links above to my AI/ML research, my blog about AI/ML and other random topics, and some of my artwork.

I'm actively seeking AI developer or developer advocate roles. I'm passionate about developing safe AI and teaching other developers how to use software. It was a challenge for me to "boot up" in AI five years ago, and it's only gotten harder since then.
