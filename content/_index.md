### Professional
I just finished my Masters of Science in Computer Science, stuyding artificial intelligence (AI) with a focus on explainable AI tools to solve the AI alignment problem. During this time, I honed my passion for research, and developed a new one for written communication. Now, I'm seeking roles where I can combine my loves of science and writing to teach.

### Personal
Outside of writing and research, I'm always down for some great music, grilled food, local brews, and the great outdoors. I love getting outside, especially to swim, but also to run and hike on trails, shoot bogey disc golf, camp on beaches and by rivers, float trip in rural Missouri, hammock in the mountains, and travel around the world (SE Asia & Europe so far). I've built most of my own furniture, helped renovate houses, cooked lots of tacos and curry, and occasionally brewed beer for final projects in university. Now I'm trying to learn how to grow salsa and speak Spanish.
