## Writer/Researcher
I am a writer/researcher from St. Louis, MO, currently in Denver, CO.

For the past five years, I [researched](/research) safe artificial intelligence, with the goal of becoming a pro writer. I focused on the intelligence and behavior aspects of AI.

- I advanced the state of the art in AI by identifying a target niche (market research), developing novel AI code, and selling my ideas through presentations and writing.
- I published five papers internationally.
- I presented my work at three international conferences.
- I wrote 250k words this past year
- I coded the HTML/CSS/JS, on-page SEO, and technical SEO of this website
- I have done a variety of other sales/marketing jobs, like University Ambassador, Tour Guide, Camp Counselor, Basketball Refereee, and Swim Instructor. I love teaching, talking, and building relationships.

## Personal
In other areas of life, I'm passionate about:
- **Reading**, obviously, here are a few blog recs: [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com), [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com), [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net), [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/)
- **Nature**, getting outside (disc golf, softball, backpacking, fishing), sustainable living, [simple lifestyles](https://mnmlist.com/brew/), and respect for nature ala [*Braiding Sweetgrass*](https://www.robinwallkimmerer.com/books) by Robin Wall Kimmerer (one of my heros).
- **Local Community**: western society is suffering, the solution is local community, my best friends and I live close together to remedy this.
- **Art**: My [Drawing](/drawing) and [woodworking](/woodwork)
- **Rationality**: Rational thought is powerful and can help you [Win Life](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-science-of-winning-at-life-sequence), but philosophy eventually ends in paradox ([Ryan Simonelli](https://absoluteirony.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/talking-in-circles-20161.pdf) explains why).
- **Math**: Just read [Lockhart's Lament](/https://worrydream.com/refs/Lockhart_2002_-_A_Mathematician's_Lament.pdf) because math is beautiful and fun, check out [this](https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) to understand the power of abstraction, and the unrelated [Marginalian article](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/16/life-on-a-mobius-janna-levin-moth/) about finding love.
- **Outlaw music** inspired by outlaw country, classic rock, hippies and cowboys, etc. Exempli gratia: Zach Bryan, Matt Maeson, Morgan Wallen, Tyler Childers, Koe Wetzl, AC/DC, Muscadine Bloodline, and many many others.
- **Craft beer**, especially [Logboat](https://www.logboatbrewing.com/) (Columbia, MO) and [Cherry Street](https://cherrystreetbrewing.com/) (Cumming, GA). I'm a sucker for a good Oktoberfest, Vienna Lager, Rauchbier, Sour, and all the other beauties that I don't feel like listing.
- **Spicy food**: I love cooking, I make [DCBS](/blog/dcbs) and I've eaten the spiciest stuff out there (made it 60 mins on the One Chip challenge {I did cry though}, ate chemically produced 9 million scoville salsa {bleh}, etc.)
