The tragedy of the commons.

The problem with living in community -- it inevitably becomes competitive, regardless of how hard we try to cooperate. The more we cooperate, the more chance there is to destroy others.

E.g. nuclear bombs... are a result of trying to stop Nazis... which is part of a long line of promoting democracy and individual right to choose. [[the-system]] encourages us to decentralize science.
