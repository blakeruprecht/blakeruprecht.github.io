- **Presence = Attention + Balance**
- **Love is attention.** Where you place your awareness reveals what you value.
- **Flow state = Happiness.** Deep, undistracted engagement in meaningful action ("in the zone") creates joy and satisfaction. Achieved by doing an [action](/action) that is engaging (you enjoy it) and challenging
- [**Balance pain and pleasure**](/dopamine) to live a good life.
- **Temperance = Disciplined Love**. It's not abstaining from stuff just for the sake of restraint or denial, discipline means fully committing to what you love so much, that you stop chasing every impulse that doesn't serve your love.
- **Moderation is clarity.** Knowing “the right amount” leads to self-control, balance, and calm—not repression, but right proportion. Moderation in all things balances with going all-in on what you truly love.
- **Wholehearted presence.** Being emotionally all-in opens space for humor, surprise, and connection. Presence is the best gift you can give someone.
