- "Stanley", 2001 *toyota 4runner* limited (3rd gen), silver, purchased by Parents from Maternal Grandparents, stock, luxury packages
- "Ron", 1997 (3rd gen) *toyota 4runner* (3rd gen), silver, blacked out windows, upgraded head unit, no muffler -- thing rode hard and fun

Dad and I fixed the tension on the gas pedal in the other 4Runner. We had two of the same car for a while -- silver third gen toyoat 4runners. Mine had blacked out windows, a custom head unit blasting loud music, and no muffler.

Blasting down Old State Road after playing basketball, petrichor in the air after a sprinkling. Windows down, sunroof open, *back window* down. Went around the corner two fast, back wheels started slipping.

I was facing the trees immediately, hurtling towards them at 30 mph. I was vaguely conscious of the rock wall to the right of the road. I careened off the road, and turned my wheel.

Black.

I open my eyes and immediately think I'm dead before my vision focuses on the black slab extending upwards past my windshield and out the sunroof. Dry land.

There's a car coming behind me, freaking me out. It must have stopped. 

Red on the ground next to me. I feel my head, no blood. Pennies from the center console...

FUCK. How do I get this damn seatbelt off before that SEMI up the road smashes into me? Oh, unbuckle... Haha, sheesh.

How do I get out? Crawl? Oh, just stand up and hop out.

Roughly six seconds passed from the moment my eyes opened, and I was walking to the side of the road, mentally shaken but physically unscathed. The dude behind me already called 911 and was asking me if I was okay. I apologized for almost hitting him.

Called my mom.

Went into an ambulance. Totally fine. A cop told me I wasn't getting a ticket, just a warning. Didn't know it was illegal to lose control of your vehicle.

Still my favorite car I've owned.
