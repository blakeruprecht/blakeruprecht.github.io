title: Smart Programming
---
For [lifting](/lifting), it's all about quantity over quality. Since recovering from [progressive-overload](/progressive-overload) is so difficult (it requires lots of sleep, calories, and protein), smart programming is the key to continually making progress with your lifts.

**Track** sets, reps, and weights lifted for every exercise
- The only way to ensure that you are [progressively overloading](/progressive-overload) your muscles is to track the sets, reps, and weight lifted for each exercise you do. This way, you can easily verify that your numbers are going up.

**Minimum Effective Dose**
- Recovery is where muscle is built, so overload the muscles as little as possible to stimulate a growth response, and then chill.
- It's better to start with too little lifting and gradually add in more volume, rather than starting with too much and never growing.

**Pick a training split** that makes sense for you
- *Full-body*: lift 3-4 x/week with a day off between every lift. Every lift will hit the entire body, all the muscles, hence the name "full-body". This stimulates the maximum growth response, since each session prioritizes big [compound lifts](/compound-lifts).
- *Upper-Lower*: 3-4 x/week, alternate doing lower body (squat, hinge) or upper body (push, pull) lifts. Easier to get more leg isolation and upper isolation exercises in.
- *Push-Pull-Legs*: 3-6 x/week, each workout focuses on one of the three categories and includes a lot more isolation lifts or compound variations.
- *Bro Split*: focuses on one muscle group per workout, e.g. Chest, Back, Legs, Arms, Shoulders. Lots of upper body volume, this tends to be overkill for most lifters unless you just do 1-2 lifts per workout.

**Good basic programs**
- *Stronglifts 5x5* - The staple for newbies everywhere, but honestly great for any lifter. Great way to make gains if you respond well to high volume. E.g. alternate A and B every time, lift MWF, e.g. week 1 MF: A, W: B, and week 2 MF: B, W: A.
	- A: Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Row 5x5
	- B: Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5
- *Wendler 5/3/1* - Very simple program with one heavy set per lift per week, great way to make gains for people who respond well to low volume.
	- A: Squat 5/3/1, Lunges 5x10
	- B: Bench 5/3/1, Chinups 5x10, Triceps 5x10
	- C: Deadlift 5/3/1
	- D: OHP 5/3/1, Rows 5x10, Biceps 5x10
- *KBoges 50/75/100* - Even simpler than Wendler with a similar philosophy -- two warm-up working sets per lift and one heavy all-out set. e.g.
	- M: Squat 50/75/100, Pushup 3x, Pullup 3x
	- W: Bench 50/75/100, Pushup 3x, Pullup 3x
	- F: Deadlift 50/75/100, Pushup 3x, Pullup 3x
