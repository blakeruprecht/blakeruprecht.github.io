NOTES
-  Pick whatever protein you like, I love chicken, You do you.
- Greens are the best bang-for-your-buck source of [micronutrients](.
	- Absolutely devoid of calories, proteins, carbs, or fats, *okay sure, there's a tiny amount, but impractical for sufficient consumption.*
	- Micro-wise, they are out of this world!
	- Deep green means healthy as fuck, mostly. 
	- Think spinach, broccoli, kale, chard, romaine, and way more I don't know of yet.
- Orange typically evokes foods like the carrot, orange bell pepper, sweet potato -- all fantastic sources of micros.
