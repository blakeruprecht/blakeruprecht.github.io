- **Attention**. Love means paying attention. Where you place you attention reveals what you value.
- **Balance**. Humans are sensitive systems and easily get out of balance. The best way to balance yourself is by regulating [dopamine](/dopamine) by balancing your personal pursuit of pain and pleasure.
- **Moderation**. Is not finding the middle path, but balancing what you go all-in on. It's not abstaining for the sake of restraint/denial/rules, it's abstaining for the sake of what you truly love.
- **Presence**. Focusing on the here and now, not the past or the future.
- **Acceptance**. The key to presence is letting go of the past and letting go of the future. [Breathing](/breathing) is a good way to practice letting go.
- **Flow**. A state of deep engagement with an action, the result of sufficient enjoyment and challenge to keep you in the zone.
- **Vulnerability**. Love requires showing up unguarded. This is courage.
- **Wholehearted**. Going all in, giving whatever action you are doing your full balanced attention in the present moment, accepting whatever comes with love. This opens space for humor, surprise, and connection.
