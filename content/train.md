title: Keep Training Simple
---
1. Anything is better than nothing. E.g. one squat.
2. Start with walking and build up stamina. Once you can walk for 30 minutes, you can add in running. Start with 1 minute runs and build from there. Building up to running three miles is a good standard. Run more if you like, I run two miles, three times per week, and vary my intensity based on how I'm feeling.
3. Train all of your muscles through the ranges of motions you want to keep for the rest of your life. Do this to feel better. The main ones to prioritize:
	- Squat: the king of all resistance movements. Use your own body weight, gravity, and/or weights (rocks, sandbags, barbells, dumbbells, etc) to put tension on the entire lower body (calves, quads, glutes, hamstrings) and full core. Take your ass to the grass, and you'll flex and extend the ankles, knees, and hips.
