Dear Electra Hiring Team,

I'm applying for the Technical Writer position at Electra. My background combines mechanical engineering with 5+ years of technical writing experience, making me well-suited to document complex manufacturing processes and quality systems.

I bring proven experience translating technical complexity into clear documentation. At Labyrinth Digital, I created integration guides and user documentation for technical tools, collaborating with product teams to document workflows and system updates. My independent work produced 50+ technical explainers using docs-as-code approaches with Markdown, Git, and Hugo. At the University of Missouri, I developed training materials and technical documentation for government partners while working across development and research teams. My mechanical engineering degree provides the technical foundation to understand manufacturing processes, while my computer science background enables me to work efficiently with documentation systems and version control.

Electra's mission to decarbonize iron production aligns with my interest in applying technical skills to environmental challenges. The opportunity to build documentation systems from the ground up in a growing company appeals to me more than maintaining existing processes at established organizations. Your emphasis on novel approaches to technical documentation, including AI tools and digital formats, matches my experience using modern tools to streamline documentation workflows.

I'm available for an interview at your convenience and can start immediately.

Blake Ruprecht
