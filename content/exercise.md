- Exercise causes physical adaptations in the body, of which there are 9 identified ones.
  - Anaerobic endurance: ability of heart & lungs to use glycogen for fuel
  - Aerobic endurance: ability of heart & lungs to use oxygen for fuel
  - Long-duration endurance: ability of heart & lungs to use fat for fuel
  - Muscular Technique: ability of a muscle to move properly through full Range of Motion
  - Muscular Strength: force output of a muscle
  - Muscular Speed: contraction speed of a muscle
  - Muscular Power: strength x speed
  - Muscular Hypertrophy: size of a muscle
  - Muscular Endurance: ability of a muscle to perform many contractions
- So it's pretty darn smart to train your Muscles and your Cardio
- To train muscles, improve your mobility using yoga and stretches, then improve the strength/power/speed/size of your muscles using calisthenics and/or weight lifting.
- For each muscle that you want to train, do 5+ sets of a resistance exercise per week, and do as many repetitions of the movement as you can until you hit failure, or get within 3 reps of failure. This is enough stress to make the muscle grow during your [recovery](/recovery). You want the failure (or 3 reps from failure) point to be between 1-8 reps for strength gains, 5-30 reps for hypertrophy gains.
  - e.g. for the chest, triceps, and front delts, perform 3 sets of pushups almost to maximum fatigue 2 times a week
- There are a lot of muscles, so people tend to break them down into Chest/Back/Arms/Legs/Core, or Push/Pull/Legs, or Upper/Lower. Here's how I think about the major movements
  - **Vertical Pull**: Pullup, Chinup, LatPulldown
  - **Vertical Push**: OverheadPress, Dip, DbSeatOHP
  - **Horizontal Pull**: Row, InvertedRow, DbRow
  - **Horizontal Push**: Pushup, BenchPress, InclineBench
  - **Core**: Plank (front), SidePlank (obliques/ql), BirdDogs (erectors)
  - **Squat**: BackSquat, SplitSquat, Pistol
  - **Hinge**: Deadlift, RDL, BackExtension
- Those are the major compound movement patterns, there are also movements to isolate every single muscle individually. I don't care too much about these because of low-ROI, but some are important:
  - Triceps, Biceps: important to isolate the arms individually
  - Lunges, Split Squats: isolate the legs individually
