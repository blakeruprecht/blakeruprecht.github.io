- Savings Rate = Amount Earned - Amount Spent
- To increase money, maximize earning and minimize spending
- Budget fixed & variable costs to minimize spending
	- *Housing*: rent, utilities, internet, insurance
	- *Transportation*: insurance, gas money, car payment
	- *Medical*: insurance, prescriptions, appointments
	- *Food*: groceries, eating out
	- *Tools*: cothes, packs, home, car, etc.
	- *Fun*: drugs, partying, entertainment, sports, etc.
- Build savings funds
	1. Emergency fund with 3-6 months worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account (SoFi?)
	2. 401K up to company match
		1. Roth or Traditional -- Roth you pay taxes now. Traditional pays taxes on withdrawal. Both never pay taxes on earnings.
	3. Max HSA (if on a high deductible health plan)
		1. Triple Tax Advantaged -- don't pay taxes on money in or out, don't pay taxes on earnings
		2. Treat as a retirement account, not a health account, because of the tax advantage -- can take money out for any use after 65
	4. Choose between funding IRA/401K, then do the other
		1. Some IRA or 401K have better investment options...
	5. Brokerage Acct (Schwab) for more liquid funds in ETFs
