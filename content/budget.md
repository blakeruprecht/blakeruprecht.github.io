OUT
- **Rent** - Pick a place to live that's relatively cheap.
- **Utilities** - Use utilities like normal, somewhat conscious.
- **Food** - Grocery shopping and eating out
- **Medical** - Health insurance and typical expenses
- **Maintain** - Transportation, Tools, Envs, etc.
- **Share** - give to others

IN
- ***Savings** - The only budget number that actually matters*
	- **Banking** - save your money in a bank
	- **Investments** - save your money in other things
	- **Taxes** - mandatory loan the gov pays back partially

Here's how I actually budget: I pick a place to live that's cheap. I minimize food spending, without sacrificing health. I pay whatever medical I need. I minimize maintenance costs. Sharing is variable.

The only number that matters is my **savings rate**. What percentage of my income do I save for later. All the other numbers just contribute to overall savings rate. Save more, more, more. To increase money, maximize earning and minimize spending

## Banks, Investments, Accounts
1. Emergency fund with 3-6 months worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account (SoFi?)
2. 401K up to company match
	1. Roth or Traditional -- Roth you pay taxes now. Traditional pays taxes on withdrawal. Both never pay taxes on earnings.
3. Max HSA (if on a high deductible health plan)
	1. Triple Tax Advantaged -- don't pay taxes on money in or out, don't pay taxes on earnings
	2. Treat as a retirement account, not a health account, because of the tax advantage -- can take money out for any use after 65
4. Choose between funding IRA/401K, then do the other
	1. Some IRA or 401K have better investment options...
5. Brokerage Acct (Schwab) for more liquid funds in ETFs
