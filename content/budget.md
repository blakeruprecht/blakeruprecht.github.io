## Time = Money
Budgeting means accounting for both your time and money in life, since money is really a means of representing time.


The simplest budgeting advice:
- Maximize your savings rate
- Increase the total amount of you save, and this naturally limits spending. Who cares what you spend, if you can cut stuff out and save more, woohoo, if you can't -- just focus on your savings rate.
- Keep it above 0% (don't go into debt)
- Save 10% -- huge!
- Save >10% -- the more the merrier!

In other words, economics, the *dismal* science.

Some people say time is money, but that's the wrong way to look at the equation. Who cares about money, time is the one finite resource in all of our lives.

So money is time.

Track your time:
- Calendar/Schedule
	- Daily Habits
- TODO lists
	- Legal
	- Medical
	- Bills

Money represents how much time you must spend working in order to trade your goods & services for other peoples goods & services.


That's extremely useful.

I get compensated for labor I do. The more useful the labor is, the more money I make. Woohoo!

The evidence of useful writing is lots of money.

So, after money I go.

## Minimize spending
Easily the biggest dial you can turn is cutting back on spending. I'm not talking specifics here, those don't matter, what does matter financially is the overall rate of savings. 

Spend less than you earn.

The more you can turn up your savings rate, the more money you'll eventually have. It's that simple. Spending money is typically a bad way to make money, except for absolute essentials.

## Investing Best Practices
You have to work by trading your labor time for capital (cash). Most people trade this cash for assets, and many people go into debt doing this.

Money can also be used to decrease the amount of time you have to give up as labor. You can do this by investing in assets that appreciate enough to give you money. If you earn 8% returns on an investment, that's just free money.

Save time, invest in assets that appreciate.

Avoid assets that depreciate.

### From Nick B.
1. Emergency fund with 3-6 months worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account (SoFi?)
2. 401K up to company match
	1. Roth or Traditional -- Roth you pay taxes now. Traditional pays taxes on withdrawal. Both never pay taxes on earnings.
3. Max HSA (if on a high deductible health plan)
	1. Triple Tax Advantaged -- don't pay taxes on money in or out, don't pay taxes on earnings
	2. Treat as a retirement account, not a health account, because of the tax advantage -- can take money out for any use after 65
4. Choose between funding IRA/401K, then do the other
	1. Some IRA or 401K have better investment options...
5. Brokerage Acct (Schwab) for more liquid funds in ETFs
