## How to identify your essentials
1. Identify actual behaviors
	- Track your daily actions, what do you actually do?
	- Tools are not the end goal, they just help action happen.
2. Eliminate non-essentials
	- Instead of reducing what you have, start from nothing and add back what you need.
	- If you can't complete an action without the tool, the tool is essential.
3. Keep only the essentials.
	- If it's not an important action, it's not an important tool.
