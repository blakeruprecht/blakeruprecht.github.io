## Future Posts (all are a W.I.P. right now)

### The Evolution of Intelligence
- [entropy](/entropy) the fundamental rule of the [universe](/universe)
- [natural-selection](/natural-selection) shapes intelligence
- [homo-sapiens](/homo-sapiens) are S-tier
- [language](/language) enables knowledge transfer
- [civilization](/civilization) beats freedom
- Western civilization has dominated the world for the past few hundred years. Why? Well, westerners are WEIRD -- Western (obviously), Educated, Industrious, Rich, and Democratic. I'm not trying to say that this makes Western culture better in any moral sense, just trying to explain why they're so damn competitive as a culture.
- [western](/western) PIEs were the original Cowboys
- [educated](/educated) because of the decentralized movement of Protestantism
- [industrious](/industrious) invention accelerates more theory/invention
- [rich](/rich) capitalistic business ventures out-compete all others
- [democratic](/democratic) liberal values
- [process](/process)

### Technical Foundations of AI
