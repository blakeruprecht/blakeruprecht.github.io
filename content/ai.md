**AI** was originally created to be a thinking machine, capable of doing whatever the hell human brains do. We still don't fully understand how human brains work, and now we don't fully understand how AIs work, but we do know how they are built.

AI is a computer program, which means it takes in words as input, converts those words to numbers, calculates the statistical relationship between the input numbers and all other numbers it knows, and responds with the most relevant numbers, which it converts back into words and outputs to the user.

[Neural Networks](/neural-network) (NN) are math equations the AI brain uses to compute the relationships between whatever happens (input) and the AIs response (output).

[Machine Learning](/machine-learning) is the process of improving the NNs statistical understanding of relationships between input and output through time.
