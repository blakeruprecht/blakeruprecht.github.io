PRACTICE
1. **Apply** to jobs
2. **Do** the work
3. **Get paid**

**Working** is getting and doing jobs that generate income. Everything else (career, mission, skills, education) exists to support this. Secure income through jobs that use my abilities and align with my direction.

**How to apply:**
1. *Inventory* everything about my past work experience with quantified impact.
2. *Extract* my relevant transferable skills, experience, and education.
3. *Match* my skills/experience/education with a real job opportunity.
4. *Mirror* their language with my *resume* to get past AI bots.
5. *Prove* the fit with a cover letter, good emails, and interviewing well.
	- *Cover Letters* show specific connection between your skills and their needs
	- *Emails* are a chance to show that you are polite and responsive.
	- *Interviews* are a change to talk about your skills and get a vibe check.
