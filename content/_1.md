**Fantasy**
Last night, I let myself completely relax and dream about what I wanted. It was Jess in that blue dress with those cowboy boots on, her long golden hair flowing around her face. I felt like **me** again, so I did what I truly wanted to do. I didn't script it, I didn't come up with any weird ideas -- I just went with the flow of the moment and let the experience be what it was. I went along with my gut feelings, and allowed myself to be as dominant as I felt like being, reacting to Jess' submissiveness. I found what worked for the two of us in that moment and led us there. I felt like a man again.

I did what I wanted, and didn't need validation from her.

**Self-Love**
This seems to be the root cause of all of my problems -- lack of self-love. I've lied to myself, cheated myself of experiences, stolen time from myself, and more. I hate myself right now because I cannot find the reasons to love myself. No more.

Fear has been driving me for a while now. Ever since I started seeking comfort and validation (a writing job) to start writing. That's been my downfall. If I would have just done what I wanted, and focused on making it work each day and in each moment, I would have done better. That's the great lesson to takeaway from this -- don't follow fear.

**Fear**
- I've been telling myself *"I can't"*, I can't make money, I can't submit my writing, I can't finish these posts
- Because -- They'll laugh at me, They'll think I'm stupid, My writing isn't good enough, I've tried before and failed -- basically, I don't love myself enough
- I'm seeking inner alignment AND comfort/validation right now
- If we love ourselves, we don't need comfort and validation

Self-Love
- Most people don't love themselves because they lie, cheat, and steal from their own soul.

Love v. Fear
- Which one you chase determines your life:
	- Love: The Angel of Discipline and Purpose, self-trust, courage
	- Fear: The Devil of Comfort and Validation, limiting beliefs, insecurity, addition to validation, paralysis
- It's not rich v. poor, success v. failure, it's always love v. fear

The System
- Build the power to bridge the gap from fear to love
- Live with a full heart, full of happiness and joy, not wanting or needing things from the external world for comfort and validation
