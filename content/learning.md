Adapt or die.

Learning is the constant process of the brain updating predictions based on new trajectories of information coming in. Trajectories can be shared from brain to brain through communication of information. Information is always an explanation of trajectories: what states and actions lead to what rewards.

Taking in more data (more information, gaining more knowledge) can help you predict future rewards better (wisdom, intelligence). This little loop, seemingly simple, is the most powerful tool humans have, and we didn't even invent it. All agents think, humans just have the largest memories and biggest computers to predict rewards far-off into the future in incredibly complex tribes of fellow predictors/thinkers. That changes with the rise of [AI](intelligence.md).
