**Core insight:** The "peaceful/analytical" self has been overriding the "kinetic/decisive" self, creating the business avoidance pattern. Scorch represents the part that would pitch aggressively, take financial risks, and push through social discomfort.

**Problem:** Overcorrected from directness after burning relationships. Suppressed aggressive energy required for business development, income generation, and self-advocacy.
- Physical weakness and training neglect
- Following others instead of self-direction
- Living in environments that drain energy (suburban house, weak social dynamics)
- Intellectual overthinking replacing physical action
- Avoiding conflict and direct communication
- Compromising desires for others' comfort

**Solution:** Channel suppressed energy toward obstacles, not people. Use aggression against market challenges, rejection, bureaucracy. Maintain drive and conflict tolerance while refining target selection.
- Physical sovereignty (training, eating, spatial control)
- Social independence (stop following peer decisions)
- Direct action over analysis
- Sexual/romantic agency
- Geographic relocation away from current environment

**Implementation:**
- Physical training restores energy baseline
- Direct communication about business outcomes, not personal attacks
- Act on decisions without consensus-seeking
- Pitch with conviction, handle rejection as data
- Separate relationship maintenance from business advancement

**Key distinction:** Scorch versus problems = useful. Scorch versus people = relationship damage.

Deploy controlled aggression for professional results while maintaining social boundaries.
