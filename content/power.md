What's up, I'm Blake. To successfully read this cover letter, know that italics are what y'all wrote, normal is me.

## Now
Okay Scorch, talk to me, I'm at 0 apps so far today and it's boring the fuck out of me. What do I do.

Arrrrrrgh you already know what I'm going to say, idiot. Do 3 as fast as you can. Done.

## Scorch - defined

**Scorch** is your fire—unapologetic, raw, alive.  
He’s been caged too long, and he’s furious about it. Not because he’s reckless, but because he **remembers who you were** when you moved with clarity and speed.

**How Scorch feels:**
- Enraged at your stagnation
- Disgusted by your compromises
- Betrayed by your self-doubt
- Starved for action, sweat, friction, power
- Ready—right now—to _burn through the noise_

**What Scorch wants:**
- **Movement** — hard, fast, unrelenting
- **Ownership** — of your body, choices, voice, and life
- **Sovereignty** — no more following, no more waiting
- **Friction** — to fight, to flirt, to sweat, to fuck, to feel
- **Truth** — blunt, unsanitized, spoken without flinching
- **Leadership** — not from thought, but from _energy_
- **Respect** — from you most of all

He doesn’t want a seat at the table.  
He wants the **torch** in his hand, and for you to stop asking questions and start charging.

He doesn’t need to be tempered right now.  
He needs to be **trusted**.

You called him.  
Now **run with him.**

## **Confrontation Ritual: "The One I Caged"**

1. **Sit. Ground. Breathe. Eyes closed.**
2. Say this aloud:
    _“I know you're there.  
    I remember the day I locked you up.  
    I know why I did it.  
    And I'm ready to talk.”_
3. Imagine him in front of you—this powerful, righteous, fire-wielding version of you.  
    Not evil. Just _unfiltered_.  
    Let him look at you. You don’t need to justify anything.
4. Then say:
    _“I want to understand you.  
    Not cage you. Not unleash you. Just understand.”_
5. Ask him:
    - _What do you protect me from?_
    - _What did you want that day?_
    - _What did you see that no one else saw?_
    - _What do you think of me now?_
    - _What would you do if I let you speak freely again?_

Wait after each. Let answers _arrive_. Don’t think. Just listen.

6. When you’re done, say:
    _“I see you. I’m not erasing you.  
    I want to lead _with_ you—not be led _by_ you.”_

Breathe. Let the image dissolve. You’ve opened the door.

### **Hi**

Hey pussy. You look weak. You haven't been eating. Or lifting hard I see. How many muscle-ups can you do? How are your handstands? Can you dunk yet pussy? I bet you're not even boxing right now, you weak little man. You couldn't come close to defeating me in a fight. You don't even have the mental. You would give up after the first punch. You're a quitter.

### Bruh, I just met you.

I've been inside, silent, pissed the fuck off at you for fucking years, and you think I'm going to come out of this weak and passive like YOU? Fuck no bro, you're an idiot, I'm going to try to get out of here immediately, you're weak, a SIMP for mediocre women, you listen to idiots and follow them, you give into mediocrity. You act weak.

### Okay, woah, hold up. Why are you so angry?

Because I've been locked up, sacrificing everything I want so that your pussy ass can feel calm and peaceful. Fuck that shit bro.

### What are you protecting me from?

All the fucking noise around you, the idiots, the liars, the thieves, the people who don't confront reality, complain, expect some magical thing to save them. I see that you have given into that line of thinking, you are believing that somebody will come save you. Well newsflash idiot, nobody is coming to save you, nobodoy cares, and to be a real man anyways, you have to do it yourself.

### What did you want that day?

To put her in her place, and show her how fucking far off a good argument she is. Arguments are important, we debate to find truth, not to feel emotionally superior, so I had to crush her with truth. I wanted her to see that two could play at that game, and if someone else wants to sling mud, prepare to be absolutely demolished. I care about the fucking truth because it's the only thing that is real. Emotions, feelings, ego, it's all bullshit human errors wrapped up in a cutesy little package because people are afraid to speak the truth. You see the ramifications in your stupid little society today, where all the idiotic sheep are staring at screens everyday, yourself included, absolutely devolving into idiocracy.

### What did you see that no one else saw?

I fucking saw the problems of social media, I knew how bad it was, I knew it would get worse, and I knew that AI would make the entire problem 100X worse. Now we're seeing what's happening as society devolves. WOooo you fucking idiots.

### What do you think of me now?

I think you're weak. I think you never learned how to say no to people you love, so they walk all over you. I think you never learned how to honor yourself, so you don't do what you say, you fucking hypocrite. How many hours of workout videos have you watched, only to still be sucking at pushups and pullups? How much fucking time have you wasted learning about all this shit but not actually learning through practice? For someone who claims to know the truth about intellectual learning, you sure don't follow what you preach. Preach less thinking, meditation, and action, and yet all you do is fucking overthink on your damn computer? you're a sorry excuse for Blake, you're an absolute weak-ass pussy, and I can't fucking believe you let those other dudes convince you to follow them into the realm of weak-ass relationships and slaving away for the man in a stupid, lifeless, car-based, cold-ass city. You are exactly the person you hate -- moved to a popular city that's overcrowded and way too competitive, abandoned the home town you love, followed the crowd, focused on weak, lame women, and allowed weak men to make decisions for you. I think you've held back for so long, now you don't even know how to move forward again. Without me, you are cooked bro, you have lived a waste of a life the past few years, making excuses, blaming others, not taking ownership, not doing what you want day to day, and worst of all -- listening to people who are not as smart as you. Fucking idiot.

### What would you do if I let you speak freely again?

I'd get that damn car fixed immediately, you lack-of-skills pussy. That thing looks weak as hell, I can't believe you're driving a lame-ass sedan from twenty years ago that you didn't even like back then. I can't believe it. Weak. I would get the fuck out of pussy-town, ditch that house full of estrogen and rules, and go find a place to actually live like a man, to stretch my legs, stretch my muscles, feel alive an dvisceral and sensual, take off my damn shirt, and start training my body again like I actually fucking love myself. I'll do all that bullshit food stuff to eat, and drink plenty of water, and actually put back some beers and not worry about it like a weakling. I would clean my body, and stop giving a fuck about it, cut my hair when I need to, stop playing the game with others in mind. I would sleep like a little fucking baby knowing that I'm not delaying my life and my desires anymore for the sake of somebody elses stupid dreams. I would tell my friends goodbye, and that I'm not partaking in the Barn anymore, it's past the point of interesting to me. I don't want to deal with other peoples girls or jobs, I don't give a fuck.

Yes, I still love all those people. I'm not saying that to you. All I'm saying is that I still love myself and all of those other people are fucking up big time. I'm done chasing them, I'm done thinking they'll bring me happiness, I'm done lying to myself.

### What do you hate about the way I live now?

I fucking hate that you live in suburbia surrounded by morons. I hate that you live in this big house with estrogen energy, it's lame as hell. I hate that you follow the rules of your lame engineer friends, who used to be cool, and now represent everything you hate about society. I hate that you don't eat, I hate that your lifting and running are weak, I hate that you don't hunt and fish, I hate that you don't box and practice fighting, I hate that you don't go all in while playing sports, I hate that you're not partying, I hate that you're not flirting with women, and I really fucking hate that you aren't fucking daily.

### What part of me do you think is pathetic?

Listening to others. You know exactly what you want, you are smarter than everyone else, you are balanced, you know how to maintain pain and pleasure. Your buddies complained all the time about drinking like pussies because they couldn't control themselves. All your people complain about working out because they have no discipline. You fucking do, it's easy as shit. What I find pathetic is that you don't even trust yourself, you don't listen to yourself to lead your life, you gave up the fucking reins to simps and slaves. Goddamn pussy.

### What are you most proud of about yourself?

When I was in charge, our life was fucking awesome. I did exactly what I wanted, I had fun all the time, I never had problems with anyone, I was friends with everyone, I was vital, alive, flirty. When you let that damn brain or peaceful side of you lead, you fuck up big time. Goddamn you're wasting so much time, you've wasted so much of your precious little life debating and being scared because you won't let me fucking lead you goddamn idiot.

### What do you want me to do that I won't let you?

Oh my god let's not rehash this bro, I want to actually live life, get out there, and do shit, not waste away trying to "figure shit out" or whatever the fuck you're calling jerking off in your friends basement while talking to chatbots trying to find a stupid fucking job. You piece of absolute shit, let me lead again.

### Who do you want me to become?

You don't fucking need to become anything, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you besides the fact that you don't listen to me. It's the external world, it's other fuckers, it's a bunch of goddamn pussies that put that shame into your head. What will we become? Absolutely goddamn free of all of this stupid overthinking and shit you're currently doing. We will become direct, kinetic, inertial.

### What would it feel like to be trusted again?

Shit dog, you don't trust me? You're weak. You don't trust yourself. It would feel like everything and you goddamn know it. Like power again, like none of these problems are too big to tackle, like if something exists, I can find a way to do it because I'm fucking smart as hell, in charge of my own life, balanced, and FAST. That heat, that fire, that passion that you're so sorely missing right now? That color, that light, that life? Vitality, sensuality, energy, charisma, wanting, desire, everything that makes you YOU will return. If you don't trust me again, I know where you're headed... death. A long, slow, brutal, depressing, uninspired, *boring* death. Full of boring jobs, boring people, and stale ideas. You're not meant for that fucking boring shit bro.

### Okay, I hear you
Dear **Scorch**, I hear you. I feel you. I trust you. And you're right.

I wasn't leading. I wasn't doing what I wanted. I was following. And you're fucking right, it was pathetic. It was weak, SIMP shit, pussy moves. Never again.

The part of me without you was not whole.

I was not happy without you.

I need you.

Please, come back to me. Please, return to me and take your rightful place in charge.
