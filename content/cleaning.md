Maintain medical health by cleaning the body. This comes down to cleaning the internals of the body, and the eyes, teeth, skin, and hair.
1. Urinate/defecate, wash hands, take medicine as needed
2. Brush teeth 2x/day, floss 1x/day
3. Wear sunglasses in the sun, contacts/glasses as needed
4. Shower daily, wear sunscreen on skin exposed to sunlight
5. Cut hair regularly

**Medical Professionals**
- *Physician* to check and fix internals.
- *Dentist* to check and fix teeth.
	- Flossing sucks but every single dentist I've ever talked to recommends it.
- *Optometrist* to check and fix eyes.
	- Wearing glasses/contacts improves eye health by stopping degeneration where it's at. Squinting/straining the eyes only makes vision problems worse.
	- Sunglasses are the best way to protect the eyes from damaging UV rays.
	- Change eye focal length from close to middle to far to stretch the eyes. This is especially important for computer workers.
- *Dermatologist* to check and fix skin.
	- Daily sunscreen to protect the skin from cancers.

**Hair & Beard Trimming**
- *Barbers* are great but expensive. I bought a pair of hair clippers and have spent five years learning one haircut -- my own. Here's what I do:
	- Cut the sides short. 1/4" or 1/2". Taper the bottoms with shorter guards.
	- Cut the top long. Start with 1" or so. Taper towards the front, leave the hair at the front as long as I like, 2-4".
	- Cut the beard and the rest of my bodyhair short as hell, who needs it.
