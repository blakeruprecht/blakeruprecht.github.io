### Energy = balance energy in and energy out
> Bunnies are machines that turn grass into more bunnies.

Humans are biological machines (aka organisms) that use the nutrients found in plant and animal matter to survive, grow, and reproduce (make more humans).

All thanks to nutrients, which is just a fancy name for food & water.

The first way to understand food is understanding that food provides energy for the body. Humans are basically machines that turn food into more humans, just like all the other animals on this earth. To keep operating, we need energy in the form of food. Unfortunately, we can't use solar power directly, we have to indirectly get it by eating plants and animals that have eaten plants and other animals.

### Macros = eat lots of protein, drink lots of water
The second essential thing to understand about food is that it provides nutrients to the body. Nutrients are chemical structures that the body uses to continue operating. Some of these structures are big molecules like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that are made of Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, and some other elements. Other nutrients are individual chemical elements (e.g. calcium, iron) or smaller molecules called vitamins.

**Water** is arguably the most essential macronutrient, even though it provides 0 calories of energy (lame! drink beer instead!).

**Proteins** have 4 calories per gram and are essential for building muscles and cells in the body. There are 9 amino acids (types of protein) that the body does not produce and needs to eat.
- 10 amino acids

**Fats** have 9 calories per gram and provide essential material to build cells, protect neurons, etc.
- Unsaturated fat
- Saturated fat

**Carbohydrates** have 4 calories per gram and provide energy to the body.
- Simple carbs
- Complex carbs
- Fiber -- technically another macronutrient, but it doesn't have calories, so who cares. It aids in digestion by providing substance to our poops. Yeah, that's pretty much it, but important to eat. You can also subtract (Fiber (g) x 4 cal/g) from your caloric total because you don't burn fiber, you poop it out.

### Micros = eat a variety of whole foods
15-25 Minerals
13 Vitamins: A, B2, B3, B4, etc.

Not an exhaustive list, just stuff I have bought before.
