	1. IDK, still figuring out how to incorporate this into my life.

## Why
- I enjoyed hitting the heavy bag every time I've had access to one. Punching feels good. Very fun. Great energy burner. Very hard on the muscles and endurance.
- "Si vis pacem, para bellum." 
	- If you wish for peace, prepare for war. Like Mr. Miyagi said, the best reason to learn to fight is so that you never have to.
- **Pankration** was the ancient Greek fighting art that combined boxing and wrestling into one mega-art. Modern **Mixed Martial Arts** replicate the same thing and create a proving ground for unarmed combat arts. From my limited knowledge, it seems like the MMA meta is specializing in one of the following, but becoming well-rounded in all aspects of unarmed fighting:
	1. **Striking** with arms and legs to damange opponent while standing. Muay Thai seems to dominate because it trains punching, elbowing, kicking, kneeing, and clinches.
		- e.g. *Muay Thai*, Boxing, Karate, Kung Fu, Dutch Kickboxing, Taekwondo
	2. **Wrestling** to takedown opponents from standing to ground. Seems pretty straightforward.
		- e.g. *Wrestling*, Judo
	3. **Grappling** for submission once on the ground. BJJ rocked the early MMA world and has been a staple ever since.
		- e.g. *Brazilian Jiu Jitsu*, Judo, Wrestling
- Armed fighting is totally different, and basically requires specific training with each weapon. Less generalizable.
	- **Rifle** fighting is the modern small-arms meta for an individual soldier.
	- **Pistol** is the modern meta sidearm of choice.
	- **Archery** when guns aren't available.
	- **Spears** are the simplest weapon ever.
