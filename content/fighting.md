I'm not talking about fighting for sport, but fighting for training and self-defense. I never plan on fighting in my life. The best reason to learn to fight is so that you never have to.

The best proving ground for fighting styles is modern MMA (mixed martial arts), where all styles of fighting are put to the test. Over the years, one thing has been proven above all -- any one method is insufficient. No one fighting style combines striking, wrestling, and grappling.

**Striking** is the main attack when standing, using punches, kicks, elbows, knees, clinches, etc.
- e.g. Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Boxing, etc.

**Wrestling** to takedown opponents from standing to ground.
- e.g. Wrestling, Judo

**Grappling** for dominance/submission once on the ground.
- e.g. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

Armed fighting is different, and requires specific training with each weapon. This mainly includes the modern battle rifle and pistol, archery, and spear fighting.
