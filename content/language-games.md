AI has proved Wittgenstein right -- words do not have any meaning in themselves, they are just scribbles on a screen, or just a random combination of sounds. Listen to anybody speak a foreign language to you, and you'll instantly understand that language is just a bunch of random noises.

We used our big brains to associate those random noises with certain things.

taught us how to use computers properly, because they showed us that words are not meaningful in themselves, they're much more similar to variables and rough approximations -- which we can also use math variables for. A word is very, very similar to an arbitrary number in hyper-dimensional space.
