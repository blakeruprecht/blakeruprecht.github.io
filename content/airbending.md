- **Wisdom**. A good life is basically doing what you want as much as possible.
- **Ownership.** Own your actions, choices, and path. You can't always choose the outcome, but you can always choose your next step. Go directly after what you desire and want out of life. [Procrastinating](/procrastinating) is a result of not valuing your actions.
- **Adapt**. Update beliefs to new evidence constantly, don't stay attached to thoughts or ideas or identities. Use a [growth-mindset](/growth-mindset) It's not the strongest, fastest, smartest, bravest, or nicest animal that survive -- it's the one most adaptable to *change*.
- **Humility**. I know that I know nothing. I'm willing to change every single thought, belief, idea, or identity that I hold. Thinking is not a complete process that leads to totally logical conclusions, it's just a tool that helps us make a good guess. We can't figure anything out fully, all life is *paradox*.
- **Simplicity**. The fastest way to go from A to B is a straight line. Even faster, turn the starting point into the ending point and you're already done! If minimum wasn't good enough, it wouldn't be the minimum. Do less, but better.
- **Stillness**. A quiet mind sees clearly. Don’t fill the space just because it’s there. Pause.
- **Humor**. This life is fucking crazy, so it's probably best to not take it too seriously.

- Rationality/thinking is not the end-goal. They are tools to help you protect what you love. If you want to get to the Moon, science is way more useful than astrology for getting there, but science/rationality doesn't give you the desire to get there. Wisdom is all about getting what you desire efficiently (because [we don't have forever](/time)).

Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.”
