What I do
- Freelance problem-solving
- Management Consulting
- Independent research and writing to crack the code
- Systems thinking
- Fundamentals across domains
- "Crack the code"
	- Learn the entire complex system/domain
	- Hack thru the complexity and noise
	- Identify the fundamental signals in plain English
	- Implement simple decision processes to achieve results

What I'm selling
- Strategic Clarity -- what actually moves the needle in any process?
- Process Optimization -- finding the 80/20 actions
- Plain English translation, from jargon -> human
- Decision frameworks to make fast decisions

Why?
- Some people are too caught in the mess to see the web
- Most people mistake complexity for sophistication
- They're afraid simple solutions make them replaceable
- Inherit systems and never question the foundations
