Tools are passive [agents](/agent): parts of the [environment](/environment) that agents can use to perform [actions](/action) [faster](/time). Tools get better over time as technology improves. Technology refers to the collective cultural knowledge of how to make tools, and the existing tools that are required to make more specialized tools.

Humans perform actions on parts of the environment (resources, e.g. water, air, sunlight, sand, dirt, rocks, metals, plants e.g. trees, animals e.g. cows) in order to change what the environment looks like, creating new passive [agents](/agent) called tools in the process.
