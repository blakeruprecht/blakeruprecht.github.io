The Operating System is the default piece of computer software that controls all of the computer hardware: *CPU, memory, storage, display, mouse, keyboard, etc.*

There are three major OSes out there today:
- **Linux** - Recommended, free and open source, most secure due to active community maintenance, built-in coding by default. Try Ubuntu, Debian, or Linux Mint.
- **MacOS** - Great because it is Unix-based, bad because it's expensive.
- **Windows** - Works fine, requires some annoying setup for dev tools.
