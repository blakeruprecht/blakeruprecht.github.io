Applying is a chance to [communicate](/communicating) your [skills, experience, education](/laboring), and personality to a potential employer to see if there's a good fit for a specific job.

## Resumes
A listing of your Personal Information (Name, Location, Phone Number, Email Address), and a brief description of your Skills, Experience, and Education.

Keep bullet points action-oriented, start them with a verb, and try to explain your impact quantitatively -- evidence speaks louder than assertions.

### Skills - what can you do?
- The meat and potatoes, can you do the tasks required of the job?
- Can only be learned by doing, demonstrated in the Experience section

### Experience - where did you do it before?
- Evidence that you have used the skills you claim to have in a professional setting with other people
- Great skills are useless without great experience, and great experience can make up for lack of skills.
- Sometimes who you know is more important than what you know.

### Education - random piece of paper
- Evidence that you have verifiably studied the knowledge you claim to have
- The most bullshit, unimportant part of any resume, for the most part this becomes little more than a checkbox for an employer.

## Cover Letters
A chance to explain the story of *you*, why you want to work at this company, your career trajectory, and how this job fits into your plan.

General business communication rules apply here: be positive, don't talk shit about anything or anyone, emphasize why you and the company are a great fit. Don't ramble about irrelevant stuff, but the more personality you can add using your own writing style, humor, and relevant anecdotes, the better this letter will be.
