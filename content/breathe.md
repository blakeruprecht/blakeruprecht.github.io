Wherever you are, sit up as straight as you can. Try to stretch your spine to the sky. Imagine a string pulling up the spot your spine would leave your skull.

Relax the shoulders. 

Relax the legs. 

Keep your core lightly braced to hold you upright. 

Close your mouth, breathe in thru the nose, out thru the nose.

Don't think about anything. Anytime you have a thought, let it go as soon as you can. Let it drift away. 

Focus on thinking about your breathing -- meditation.

Focus on a single task -- flow.
