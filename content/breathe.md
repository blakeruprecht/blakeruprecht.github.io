I want to give you a sword. You can't hold it, nor can I, yet you can use it. This sword enables you to slash your thoughts to pieces. With it, you can leave all of your worries behind, and forget about the past.

The sword = *doing absolutely nothing*.

Well, except for *breathing*.

Doing absolutely nothing but breathing is non-action.

Not thinking, not wondering, not planning, not moving. Just purely focusing on the sensation of your breath, in and out.

Doing nothing, we come home, back to the here and now. We realize that we are alive. We realize that there is nothing outside of this moment. All thoughts of past and future are abstractions in our head.

If we choose to, we can slash all of those thoughts to ribbons, and be left with only the present moment.

By breathing, we can let go of fear, shame, guilt, anger, etc.

By breathing, we can feel happiness, joy, peace, and calm, right now.

By focusing on our breath, we learn how to pay loving attention to the present moment. The art of non-action teaches us how to do every action better.
