Here's my current computer setup for [computing](/computing).

- [operating system](/operating-system): Debian Linux
- [terminal](/terminal): Blackbox
- text editor: Obsidian, Cursor, Nano
- browser: Firefox, Brave

	- version control: Git

**What computer should I buy next?**
- (Under $100) old Lenovo X220 -- still plenty good for modern computing with Linux installed
- ($100-$400) used Dell XPS 13 or Macbook Air -- what I currently have, still more than enough computer for all of my work use cases. Not for gaming though.
- ($400+) newer Dell XPS 13 or Macbook Air
- ($1000+) [Build your own computer](/building-computers)
