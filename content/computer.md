A tool to improve thinking

Here's my current computer setup:
- [Hardware](/computer-hardware): Dell XPS 13 9370 laptop, iPhone 13 Mini smartphone
- [Operating System](/os): Debian Linux (laptop), iOS 18 (phone)
- Programs:
	- Blackbox ([terminal](/terminal))
	- Obsidian, VSCode, Cursor, Neovim, Nano (text editors)
	- Firefox, Brave (browsers)
	- Gimp (image editor)
	- Zathura (pdf viewer)
	- Discord (messaging)
- Languages: 
	- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (default for [websites](/websites))
	- [Python](/python)
	- Go (for Hugo)

I also have a phone (iPhone 13 Mini) running iOS 18 which I don't use for any real computing.

## Why
I'm a [computer science master](/research), so take these recommendations with a grain of salt. I've installed many different OSes, built my own computer, revived long-dormant old laptops, hand-built my own website, and coded in many different languages.
