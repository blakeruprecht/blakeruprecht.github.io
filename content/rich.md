What makes WEIRD people so Rich?


Capitalism enabled humans to escape the [[Poverty Trap]]. This was absolutely huge. It enabled this by creating a system where people could pool their money together to pay for risky ventures -- that could end disastrously or pay off big. This way, no single person has to take on the entire risk of a venture.

This idea, while obvious to us today, was not so obvious to humans as recently as 1650.
