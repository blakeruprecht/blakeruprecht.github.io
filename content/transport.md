title: Transport
---
The easiest form of human transportation is [walking](/walk). We evolved to be bipedal to become efficient walkers and runners on the grasslands of Africa after our ancestors came down from the tree. As a result, our upper bodies got weaker, and our glutes got huge! Fun fact, humans have the biggest glute:weight ratio in the animal kingdom. We are defined by our asses.

The most efficient form of human transportation is the **bicycle**. Cycling uses 3-4x less energy for an equivalent walk, while being way faster as well (15-20 mph vs 3-4 mph). A human on a bike is 5x more efficient than the most efficient land traveler (the horse). Cyclists are slightly more efficient that the most efficient flyers, the condor. Bicycles are relatively cheap (<$200 used in the USA), easy to maintain, and incredibly cost-effective. The Netherlands is leading the world in bicycle adoption.

Public transportation is pretty cool, though heavily dependent on local infrastructure and government. Here in the USA, most people use private transportation, besides flying on planes. It's a serious bummer. I've used trains and busses in other countries, and would now pick that every time I have the option.

**Cars** are pretty cool, I will admit. In Thailand and Laos, I rode on mopeds/scooters, and those were really fun, way more dangerous, and way easier to maintain than a car. Cars are incredibly complex machines and require a ton of maintenance, like regular oil changes, and all of the other essential things they require to keep living. Luckily, quality reliable cars can be bought for under $10,000 in the USA, which is honestly still a fuck ton of money.

New cars are a money pit due to rapid depreciation, so they are one of the best assets to buy if you want to get rid of a lot of [money](/money). 

Otherwise, the most sensible car to own is a +10 year old Honda/Toyota/Mazda hatchback that's still in good condition.
