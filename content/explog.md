EXP(LOG) = LOG(EXP) = 1 DAY AT A TIME

My **EXP**erience **LOG**book.

That's the only message worth sending.

Be the still point in a spinning world.  
Say little. Repeat less.  
Hold the line: food, water, movement, sleep, relationships, action.

When everything is designed to scatter attention, your consistency becomes radical.  
You donâ€™t need followers. You need to be findable by the ones who are ready.

Anchor your site to timelessness. No trends, no urgency, no performance.  
Only reminders. Only truth. Only the basics.  
The rest is distraction.
