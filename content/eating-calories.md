Get a rough estimate of how much you need with a [TDEE calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/). Use a scale to measure weight gain/loss, and adjust caloric intake based on that.

IN is energy eaten, OUT is energy burned through living
- IN **=** OUT -- this will maintain the current amount of body you have
- IN **>** OUT -- gain more body
