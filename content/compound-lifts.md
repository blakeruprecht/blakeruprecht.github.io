All you really need are the basic compound lifts in order to build muscle.

There are a million and one different exercises using different equipment to target every muscle in a myriad of different ways. It's overwhelming. Luckily, most of those options are useless for the average person. As with anything, the **fundamental lifts** are basic and provide most of the returns.

In general, the fundamental lifts can be broken up into the major movement patterns: the squat, the hinge/lift, the pull, and the push.

If you focus on the major movement patterns, you'll know how to switch out exercises based on what [gym](/gym) equipment you have available. E.g. you could do bodyweight variations for all of these, or use barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, or machines for each of these patterns.

## Squat
- Movement: bend at the knees to lower ass to the grass
- Main Muscles: quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings*
	- Depending on your form, squats can target the hamstrings pretty well, or not much at all.
- Secondary Muscles: hamstrings, calves
- Examples:
	- *Squat*: Bodyweight, Db Squat, Bb Back Squat, Bb Front Squat
		- Targets the quads more
	- *Split*: Bulgarian Split Squat, Lunge
		- Targets the glutes more, the Bulgarian is extremely hard and GOATed.

## Hinge
- Movement: lift heavy thing off the ground
- Muscles: hamstrings, glutes, spinal erectors, latissimus dorsi, biceps
- Examples:
	- *Hinge*: Romanian Deadlift (RDL), Deadlift, Kb Swing, Glute Bridge
		- Targets the hamstrings really well. Deadlifts/RDL/Swings utilize the back heavily, specifically the lower back (erectors) and lats. Other hinge patterns like glute bridges don't use the back much.
	- *Split*: One Leg RDL
		- Same, but one side at a time, still hamstring dominant.

## Pull
- Movement: pull the hands towards the body
- Muscles: latissimus dorsi, trapezius (all 3), biceps, rear delts
- Examples:
	- *Vertical*: Pullup/Chinup, Cable Lat Pulldown
		- Targets the lats more, and chinups are the best bicep grower.
	- *Horizontal*: Inverted Row, Db Bentover Row, Bb Bentover Row
		- Targets the trapezius and rear delts more
	- *Hinge*: there's a lot of overlap between Deadlifts/RDL/Swings and pulling, since the lower back, lats, traps, rear delts, and biceps are holding the weight in the hinge movement.

## Push
- Movement: push the hands away from the body.
- Muscles: chest, front delts, triceps
- Examples:
	- *Horizontal*: Pushup, Ring Pushup, Db/Bb Bench Press, Db/Bb Incline Bench
		- Targets chest, front delts, and triceps
	- *Vertical*: Pike Pushup, Handstand, Db/Bb Overhead Press
		- Targets mainly front delts and triceps
	- *Dips*: targets both the lower chest and front delts really well, as well as being the best tricep exercise, the dip is GOATed.

## Core 
- Movement: stabilizes the entire body during every movement, rotates the body
- Muscles: abs, obliques, spinal erectors, some weird internal muscles
- Examples in the four different planes of motion
	- *AntiExtension*: Plank, Ab Rollout, Hanging Leg Raise
	- *AntiLateral*: Suitcase Deadlift, Side Plank
	- *AntiRotation*: Pallof Press
	- *Rotation*: Woodchopper, Russian Twist
