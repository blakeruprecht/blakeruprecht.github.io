> "Devouring time, blunt thou the lion's claws, and make the earth devour her own sweet brood, pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, and burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood." (William Shakespeare, Sonnet 19)

> "Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do, than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."  (Mark Twain)

> "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime." (Mark Twain)

> "The law of work seems unfair, but nothing can change it; the more enjoyment you get out of your work, the more money you will make." (Mark Twain)

> "What work I have done, I have done because it has been play. If it had been work, I shouldn't have done it." (Mark Twain)

> "Who was it who said, "Blessed is the man who has found his work"? Whoever it was he had the right idea in his mind. Mark you, he says his work--not somebody else's work. The work that is really a man's own work is play and not work at all. Cursed is the man who has found some other man's work and cannot lose it. When we talk about the great workers of the world we really mean the great players of the world. The fellows who groan and sweat under the weary load of toil that they bear never can hope to do anything great. How can they when their souls are in a ferment of revolt against the employment of their hands and brains? The product of slavery, intellectual or physical, can never be great." (Mark Twain)

Strategies
- Travel; Engage with people; Explore ideas; Write about it
- Lead with Ne: opt for an unconventional lifestyle (Ne), and something more creative and risky (Ne), instead of family life (Si) and security of a conventional career (Si)
- Lean into Ne, curiosity, fun, excitement; fuck Si
- Done is better than perfect
- Shoot from the hip
- Additive Limitations: time-wasters, phone, internet
- Subtractive Limitations: bad clothes, no work out setup
- Do the one thing, deliberately, intensely. Everything else is there to relieve mental strain
- Go small: only what matters most
- Go extreme: one thing
- Say no: to most everything (especially the good, but not great, options!)
- Things are unequal: don't bother with checklists
- In your effort to do all things, nothing gets done

2022-06-10: I think the lesson from RL is this: the more succinctly you can define winning, the better chance you have of finding a good solution. This is obvious in sports, where the best players are those the most focused on winning. Thus, to figure out the big why, figure out what you want to win at. What are your top priorities, and how can you act to make sure those are the focus of your life?

- Think Big: if your plan is huge, you practically guarantee smaller goals
- Think Different: people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, do
- Act Bold: now do it: figure out the actions, systems
- Don't Fear Failure
- If you can honestly say "this is where I'm meant to be right now, doing exactly what I'm doing", then all the great possibilities for your life become possible
- Discover Your Big Why: what gets you up in the morning, drives you when you're tired and worn down?
- Strategize: break a big goal down into small steps to achieve it
- 1. Build a bunker, 2. Store provisions; 3. Sweep for mines; 4. Enlist support

1. Follow the path to MASTERY: deliberate practice
	- Jigoro Kano, founder of Judo, was buried in his white belt
2. Seek to do something the best it can be done.
	- This may require new thinking, new skills, and relationships
3. The Accountability Cycle: take complete ownership
	- Results oriented, Bring your best, Do whatever it takes

1. Learn to say NO: everything is a trade-of
	- The more things you do, the less successful you are at any of them
2. Accept Chaos: focusing on one thing means others don't get done — make it happen even when life is chaotic
	- When you commit to your one thing, in time, it allows you to manage the chaos
3. Manage your energy and health: connect these habits to your success
	- Meditation and spirituality: start the day by connecting with your higher purpose
	- Exercise and Nutrition
	- Loved Ones: motivation to be productive, emotional energy
	- Positive energy in the morning creates positive momentum
4. Take ownership of your environment: the people and physical environment (house, phone, etc.) surrounding you must support your goals.
	- Remove all physical barriers to getting work done.

1. Spend time exploring options before you commit -- take note of what you're good at and what sucks
2. Don't be afraid of limits, then narrow down to 2-3
3. Limit yourself and set goals. STICK TO THEM.
4. Optimize constantly to remove the boring stuff.
5. Fuck your dreams, you'll just talk a big game all your life until you're 35, realize you haven't committed to anything, and then finally buckle down and work hard at some bullshit job.

### Motivators
- Debates & discussions about an issue
- Parties or big gatherings of people
- One on one discussions with people (coffee, chat, phone, smoke sesh, beers)
- Considering complex problems and ideas
- Creating original, exciting plans

### Stressors

## 2.5 StrengthsQuest, 2017
1. Learner
2. Self-assurance
3. Competition
4. Achiever
5. Ideation

## 2.6 VIA Character Strengths, 2021
There's 24 of these. At most, 12 can be strengths, but I think it's most likely fair to pick six of these as core strengths.
1. **Curiosity**: Interested, explores new things, open to new ideas
2. **Love of learning**: Masters new skills & topics, systematically adds knowledge
3. **Creativity**: Original & adaptive, clever, a problem solver, sees and does things in a different way
4. **Bravery**: Shows valor, doesn't shrink from fear, speaks up for what is right
5. **Honesty**: Authentic, trustworthy, sincere
6. **Zest**: Enthusiastic, energetic, doesn't do things half-heartedly
7. **Leadership**: Organizes group activities, encourages a group to get things done.
8. **Humor**: Playful, brings smiles to others, lighthearted

## 2.7 Workplace Insights, 2024
**NOTABLE TRAITS**
- Work, Communication, and Interaction Style
	- **Goal-oriented**: You tend to be goal-oriented and intent on meeting or exceeding the expectations set for you. You have good follow-through on tasks when engaged with your work.
	- **Very Independent, Aggressive**: You are likely to have a strong individualistic streak and will be comfortable influencing others and advancing your own interests. Individuals with low cooperative scores are often motivated to take the lead on work projects and can be a good fit for independent, competitive, and results-oriented fields such as sales or managerial roles.
- Temperament, Attitudes, and Outlook
	- **Very Competitive**: Compared to most people, you have a very strong drive to win. You are likely to be highly motivated by competition and will strive to meet and exceed external targets. In work settings, highly competitive individuals often excel in fields such as sales but are sometimes less well suited to roles like customer service.
	- **Very Intellectually Curious**: You are far more open to new experiences than the average person. You tend to not only embrace exploring and learning but go out of your way to actively seek these opportunities. You are likely to have a wide range of interests and likely have a strong preference for novel experiences over routine. You are also far more likely than others to embrace change, and engage in self-reflection and creative or imaginative thought.
