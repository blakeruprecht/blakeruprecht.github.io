What is the origin of WEIRD work ethic?

should be renamed to the Energy Revolution, because the added energy in the system is the main catalyst for increased productivity. It basically just speeds up the two-pronged development of Theory/Experiment and Machine
	- We have been using [[the-art-of-science]] for hundreds of years -- experimentation, simplifying topics, and developing theory. This is nothing new, it's basic trial and error with some obvious rules to make sure you're not getting bad results
		- We don't care about TRUTH in some amorphous sense, we care about being EFFECTIVE, because all scientific thought has been tested. You cannot get to the Moon with astrology.
	- Machines are now more powerful than humans, so all of our efforts go into figuring out how Machines can take over every human task possible -- the Great Big Lie
	- We ignore the [[Old Ways]] in favor of giving our lives over to the system, because if you don't, your civilization will be swallowed by [[Moloch]]
	- We create better and better machines to improve all of the traditional sectors of the economy, let's look at them:
		- Farming: many inventions go towards improving farm production
		- Crafts: many invention go towards making new tools which change life.
		- Military: many inventions go towards killing our enemies.
		- Religious Leaders:
		- Government:

The interplay between Scientific theory and Mechanical invention leads to smaller and better machines, and more advanced theory. Our understanding of math evolves to the point where we figure out what atoms are made of.

## The Old Ways
Back in the olden days (10,000 BC until 1950 AD), depending on where you lived in the world, your local economy consisted of the following jobs:

Farmer
Blacksmith
Merchant

Wood

## The New Ways
- Concrete - infrastructure
- Steel - machines
- Fertilizer - population growth
