title: Stretching
---
I stretch to loosen up my muscles and to fix imbalances in my posture. While [lifting](/lifting) does the lions share of posture correction, I also target a few specific stretches to help with my weak points.

To fix my forward neck and forward shoulders:
- Chin Tucks
- Wall Slides
- Cat Cows

To fix my anteriorally-tilted hips:
- Couch Stretch
- Deep Squat
- Glute Bridges
- (optional) Hamstrings, 9090/Fisherman Squat
