title: Stretching
---
I stretch to loosen up my muscles and to fix imbalances in my posture. While [lifting](/lifting) does the lions share of posture correction, I also target a few specific stretches to help with my weak points.

My current stretching routine:
- **Chin Tucks** - help fix my forward neck
- **Wall Slides** - improve shoulder mobility
- **Cat Cows** - stretch entire spine
- **Couch Stretch** - loosen hip flexors to fix APT
- **Deep Squat** - trains a ton of different abilities in one
- **Glute Bridges** - activate my sleeping glutes
- (optional) Hamstrings, 9090/Fisherman Squat
