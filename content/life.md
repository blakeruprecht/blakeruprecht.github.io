What are we playing again?
Living.
Surviving. Breathing. Yup, just staying alive, keeping that heart beat going. That's it. The biggest picture view of most of this wholel shin dig is people protecting their own lives, protecting those of the ones they love, and that not always working out between two people. Which leads to [[death]].
