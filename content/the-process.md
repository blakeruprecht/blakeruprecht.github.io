Over and over again until I get it right.

Commit to it. All-in on this practice. Dedicate yourself to focusing, paying attention, giving this your all, putting your entire bleeding heart into it.

As many reps as necessary.

For every new task, I understand what's up. Play the long game. Forever.

Commit to becoming a student of the game. Humble yourself, let go of your pride, and open your eyes to the lessons that come with every failure. The best lesson I have learned in life is this -- if I keep my eyes clear, and my heart full, I cannot lose. At least not forever.

I am inevitable.

I will never stop learning, improving, \%\*\$\#\^$\*\% up and getting better.

White belt for life. Student until I die. Learner. Beginner. Fool. The name doesn't matter. Baby. Earthling. Martian. I'm game. I'm here to play.

It is literally the only way.
