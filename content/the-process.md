title: The Process

## The Process
- Ground yourself to align (elephant, king)
- Free yourself to simplify (crow, magician)
- Accept yourself to play (dog, lover)
- Choose yourself to create (tiger, warrior)

## EARTH 🐂
> *Integrity* - Unshakable alignment of thought, word, and action.
- **Ground** myself in being alive, here, now. That's enough.
- **Own** everything. Stand firm.
- **Reciprocate** the love life gives.
- **Align** thoughts, words, and actions — especially when it’s hard.

## AIR 🐦‍⬛
> *Clarity* - Undistorted perception and lightness of mind.
- **Free** myself from illusion -- past stories, future destinations.
- **Question** everything. Nothing is sacred.
- **Adapt** fluidly to new data.
- **Simplify** to only the signals that matter (e.g. love).

## WATER 🐶
> *Presence* - Full surrender to the moment, feel everything, resist nothing.
- **Accept** what is, not what should be.
- **Feel** deeply. Let all sensations come and go.
- **Open** myself up to experience with total vulnerability
- **Play**, experience joy, and connect with others.

## FIRE 🐯
> *Courage* - Willingness to act through fear. Consistent, bold creation of life.
- **Choose** what you want, ignore fear/doubt/uncertainty/permission/proof.
- **Initiate** action, go first, lead the way, hesitation kills.
- **Burn** with max intensity, full send, all-in, no holding back, shoot the shot.
- **Create** life through steady, wild, rhythmic energy.
