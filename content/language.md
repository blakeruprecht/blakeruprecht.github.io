title: Language

Language is a series of grunts, groans, and babbles that humans magically learn to associate with different states and actions of reality.

If I say *blarg* and demonstrate skipping a rock to you, you'll pretty quickly learn that *blarg* either means "I skip", "you skip", "we skip", "skip" or something along those lines. Do *this action* whenever I say *blarg*.


- [language] enables [information] and knowledge transfer
	1) Speech leads to myth, song, drums, dance, and *stories*, which become the first...
	2) Stories/myths/memes, culture passed from one mind to another
	3) Writing - written language, can be passed down farther, and wider than ever before -- culture starts to spread, ideas start to spread
