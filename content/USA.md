title: USA

I'm from [STL](/STL), [MO](/MO), USA.

America is a confusing place to live. It's the wealthiest country in the world, but not for most. It's the most beautiful country in the world, but difficult to travel through. It's a land of extremes. Extremely big, extremely fast, extremely brutal.

Everybody knows the USA is great in a lot of ways, and evil in others.

## American spirit
I'm still a fan. No, it's not perfect. But I follow an American spirit inspired by the heroes of old, the Washingtons, Lincolns, Roosevelts, Kennedys, D-Day paratroops, Bunker Hill musketeers, Iwo Jim flag raisers, General Grant holding the line, Underground Railroad fighters, "I Have a Dream" ministers, freedom and equality promoters.

An America where
- all people have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
- all people are created equal, regardless of *shit*
- freedom means being the leader of your own life
