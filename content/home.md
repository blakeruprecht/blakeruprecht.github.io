A **home** is basically a permanent shelter that you stay in. As homes get more complex, they include more and more tools for convenience. E.g. the simplest home is a cave or natural shelter. Expanding from there, you can add in artificial walls (like a tent, van, apartment, or house) to create an official bedroom. Add in some plumbed water, and you've got a bathroom. Setup a campfire or plumb some gas and you have a kitchen. 

## Bedroom
The simplest bedroom consists of a roof and floor, maybe with walls. Like a cave, tent, apartment, or house.

## Bathroom
The great outdoors still works as a toilet. A water source is needed for washing hands/sink work, showering, and laundry. Some tools are needed for each of those.

## Kitchen
The room that makes a place a home. A place to store food, cook, and eat it.

## Living
Everything else done at home goes in the living section. This is the biggest differentiator in most homes. Every home has a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen in different layouts, but then lots of tradeoffs are made to prioritize dining rooms, TV rooms, sitting rooms, outdoor space, garage space, etc.
