I want a place where I can recommend my favorite blogs for others to go read. Oh, look, here it is!


## Blogs
*NOTE: I linked my favorite article from each blog.*
- [mnmlist](https://mnmlist.com/brew): by Leo Babauata, great blog about minimalism, this post really hits home for me.
- [zen habits](https://zenhabits.net/no-goal): also by Leo B., covers zen and applying it to life, e.g. having no goals is fun!
- [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html): Tim Urban does long-form better than anybody, and visualizes important things in fascinating ways.
- [Mr Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/11/24/efficiency-is-the-highest-form-of-beauty/): Pete writes about saving money, but for the purpose of living a better life.
- [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/162/) The best online comic strip to ever come out.
- [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/16/life-on-a-mobius-janna-levin-moth/): Maria Popova features some amazing stuff, this one made me cry when I first read it.
- [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html): entrepreneur turned essayist, this post about working hard is better than most career advice.
- [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/confab): Derek has some pure gold, especially his stuff about "useful not true" and "hell yeah or no."
- [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com): Alexey's ## Advice section is really good, I wish I could tell my college self some of this.
- [Tal Raviv](https://speakerdeck.com/talraviv/more-constraints-please): More constraints can actually be better, I'm shocked. Tal's blog is currently down.
- [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-science-of-winning-at-life-sequence): love this sequence about applying rationality to life
- [Ravi Gupta](https://rkg.blog/water.php): Ravi's got a quick blog, but most of the posts on the left are really good.
- [No Mercy No Malice](https://www.profgalloway.com/): marketer Scott Galloway, I like the design

## Individual Articles
- [A Mathematician's Lament](https://worrydream.com/refs/Lockhart_2002_-_A_Mathematician's_Lament.pdf): by Paul Lockhart, the best essay I've ever read about math as art.
