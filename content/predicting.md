My brain **predicts** the statistical association between state-action pairs and rewards gained from those states. It learns to associate state-action pairs with rewards that happen well into the future after said state-action pairs through statistical association. Basically, if a specific action in a specific state keeps leading to the reward, keep doing that action in that state.
