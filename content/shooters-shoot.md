## Achilles
The gods envy us because we are mortal. Because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed.

We'll never be lovelier than we are now. We will never be here again.

They'll wonder long after we're gone about how bravely we fought, how fiercely we loved.

The only wrong answer is nothing.

## Shooters shoot... and miss a lot
Babe Ruth, the Great Bambino. You know what they never mention? The strikeout king. It's just the way it has to be. If you want to be a slugger in baseball, you gotta swing, and that means you're going to strikeout. The best home run hitters in baseball have struck out more than anybody else. They don't strike out looking.

The best shooters have missed more than anybody else. Steph Curry hits slightly over 40% of his three-pointers in game. 

In every endeavor of my life, the message time and time again has been the same: try, and try again. Learn from your mistakes. Make errors, adjust, move forward. Iterate. Grind. Call it what you will, same principle. The greats fail a lot, and instead of getting dejected, learn from the mistakes.

So to be great, don't focus on what you love to do. Focus on what you love to learn from. What mistakes feel easy to keep making and correcting?

If you're gonna shoot, you gotta expect to make it, and mentally deal with a miss. That's it.

## Practice
We talking 'bout practice?

Practice. There are no games in life, just practice. Just trying to get better in every moment.

How you do one thing is how you do everything.

That extends to brushing teeth. Sitting in a chair. Talking on the phone. Organizing a cupboard. All of the shit in life. And so much of it is shit. Suffering all around, as Buddhists might say.

Get rid of what you don't want to practice, but inevitably, many of the same things will come up again. Like brushing your teeth.

Basic maintenance tasks to keep life going. Ignore them, and you may be fine, but you'll inevitably die. Everyone does.
