> Keep It Simple, Stupid

Black ink on a white page. Minimal accent colors for links/highlights if need be. Focus on the content.

Today's web is full of ugly, bloated websites that shove a bunch of crap in the users face. They are obviously marketing ploys designed to maximize engagement and revenue, not maximized for usability.

I made my website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (not really), and Hugo, a static-site generator that produces fully built web pages, no fluff.
