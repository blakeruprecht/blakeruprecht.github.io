An [agent's](/agent) [predicted](/predicting) best course of [action](/action) through time to get from the current [state](/state) to a [reward state](/reward). 

The policy describes a future [trajectory](/trajectory) of state-action pairs which lead to a state in which the agent's perceived [reward](/reward) is high.

A policy is an approximation, since any individual agent has an incomplete description of their state, as well as an incomplete memory, as well as incomplete knowledge of the environment to predict the future.

It's a best guess at predicting which future state-actions will lead to reward.
