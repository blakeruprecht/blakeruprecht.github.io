title: Sleep Consistently
---


Sleep is like the best [Hygiene](Hygiene.md) we can give ourselves. Rest to let the body do it's natural recovery thing. Of course, it doesn't solve everything, but it's like a mirror of the general health of our lives.

Good sleep is indicative of low stress, general health, good heart and lungs, relaxed muscles, etc. And bad sleep messes up the rest of life.

In that sense, sleep is like the foundation of health for everything else. It enables you to process nutrients, rebuild muscles, improve lung efficiency, store memories, process learnings, and much more. The science is still unsure on all the effects sleep has on the body.

But we know for sure that sleep is important.

Luckily, optimal sleep practices are pretty simple.

Sleep is pretty much all about consistency. Humans evolved to wake with sunrise and get sleepy after sunset. In our modern zoos, we don't quite live like that, but we can emulate some of the traditional qualities of human sleep.

Waking up at the same time everyday and immedialy getting morning sunlight is great. So if you wakeup at the same time everyday and immediately get sunlight into your eyes, this basically tricks your brain into thinking your wakeup time is sunrise.

Then, all you have to do is go to bed whenever you're tired. Your body will start to naturally regulate itself, getting tired at night before bed and wanting as much sleep as it wants.

Setting a consistent bedtime works too.

## Duration
Probably the most important factor. Each person is different in the amount of sleep they need, but most humans fall in the 6-10 hour region. I wish I was one of those people who only needs 4 hours of sleep, but I think I'm a 7. I was a 9 for a while, not fun.

## Light
Sunlight regulates our circadian rhythyms, so it's essential to get as much sunlight during the day as possible.

**View morning sunlight**. Bright morning sunlight gives your body the signal to wake up and get moving.

**View evening sunlight**. Try to get outside into the sunlight in the evening before sunset as well. As the light shifts towards the redder end of the spectrum, your body interprets this as a signal to start preparing for sleep.

**Limit light exposure at night.** Blue light is great during the day, but keeps us awake at night. After sunset, turn off all lights and only use candles/red lights.

## Temperature
**Temperature** between 60-70 deg F. Regulate this with blankets.

**Lighting** as dark as possible, with only candles/red lights at night.


I'm no medical doctor, take this information about the body with a big pinch of salt.

All animals perform cleaning rituals. I'm not sure why, but it seems like cleaning and organizing make us feel safe and secure, because we can see more threats and have a clearer view of our surroundings. Something like that. Plus, if you don't, you'll probably get sick and die.
