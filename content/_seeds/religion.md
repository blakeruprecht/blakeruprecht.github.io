## Gratitude
Gratitude practice is a mental trick to instantly calm down the body and improve feelings of relaxation and contentment. I don't know that for certain, but it feels right.

Think about 1 thing you are grateful for. Sometimes it spirals.
1. **Ground and look around** - The ground beneath my feet. The fresh air all around me. Clouds, rains, and rivers. The sun in the sky. Fires. Wild plants. Trees. Oaks. Food plants, chilis, onion, garlic, wheat, barley. Medicine plants. Bacteria and the tiny animals. Wild fish. Trout. Tuna. Insects. Amphibians. Reptiles. Birds. Crows. Hawks. Eagles. Songbirds. Big thanks to Chicken. Mammals. Squirrels. Deer. Wolves. Bears. Pigs. Horses. Big thanks to Cow. Big thanks to Cat and Dog. All of humanity. My people.

## Be Kind Anyway
> “People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered. Forgive them anyway.
> 
> If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.
> 
> If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies. Succeed anyway.
> 
> If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you. Be honest and sincere anyway.
> 
> What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight. Create anyway.
> 
> If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous. Be happy anyway.
> 
> The good you do today, will often be forgotten. Do good anyway.
> 
> Give the best you have, and it will never be enough. Give your best anyway.
> 
> In the final analysis, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway” —Mother Teresa


> SAM HARRIS: "Until you learn to meditate, you think the outside world and the circumstances of your life have to get arranged so that the present moment can become good enough to demand your attention in a way that feels fulfilling, that makes you happy. If it's running you think: "Okay, I gotta get back out there, it's been over a year, when am I going to be able to run again? That's the *only* place I feel content and at ease." or "I have a ton of work to do, I'm not going to be able to feel good until it's all done."
> 
> You always think your life has to change, that the world has to change, so that you finally have a good enough excuse to just be *here*, and here is enough. Where the present moment is totally captivating.
> 
> Meditation is the discovery that you can just totally train yourself to do that on demand, that just looking at a cup can be good enough in precisely that way. Any sense that it might not be is recognized to be a thought that mysteriously unravels the moment you notice it, and then there's no evidence that this isn't the best moment of your life. The sense data don't have to change, but the sense that there is some kind of basis for doubt about the rightness of being in the world in this moment can evaporate when you pay attention.
> 
> The meaning of life for me is to live in that mode more and more, and to recognize when I'm not in that mode, and return to it."

> There is no path to peace, peace is the path.
> There is no path to happiness, happiness is the path.
> There is no path to love, love is the path.

Listen to nature.
Follow the path.
Peace isn't the goal, peace is the path.
Love isn't the goal, love is the path.
Happiness isn't the goal, happiness is the path.

Accept all humans.

Quotes come mostly directly from the movie.

> You didn't get what you wanted. I know it broke your heart too.

In reference to Dan breaking his leg and not being able to chase his dream of olympic gymnastics. For me, this is about not achieving the BARN out of college, my main dream. I feel devastated that my friends have moved away and aren't in a position to make this happen. I was sad when James married Sierra, because I felt like he started moving his life in a different direction. Scov moving to Colorado, Bremer dating Alex and settling in Atlanta, all make it feel like it's getting harder and harder, and that they don't want to make it happen. Obviously they don't, it's not their number 1 priority, and it was always mine. It's their number 2 or 3, which is perfectly okay. It just sucks that I'm not getting my number 1 and they are, but damn, I'm happy for them as well as sad for me.

> 1st realization of a warrior: not knowing

This is where I'm at right here, right now. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to proceed, I'm stressed about not having a job, I feel like I'm not writing anything worthwhile, I'm in a tough spot, very confused, hence why I've turned to the wisdom of this book.

> D: What do you do if you can't do what you were born to do?
> S: Everything has a purpose, even this. It's up to you to find it.

I feel like I was born to write, but I don't know how to do it. I feel like I can't right now. According to Soc, I need to find out why, I need to learn from this experience, I need to recognize that this is happening for a reason, and it's up to me to find it. 

> There is no better. You will never be better than, or less than, anyone else.

> The ones who are hardest to love are the ones that need it the most.
> Wisdom is in the doing.

This is in reference to the muggers who take their things, and it makes me realize, I want to be in a position where I can give away everything I own to those who need it, and just maintain the bare minimum possessions. It's easy to say that you love others and want to serve, it's much harder to actually love others and actually serve.

> A warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does.

This seems like an absolute call out to not give up writing, but to find the love in it. I can't just automatically love it, I have to develop my skills and abilities to love what I'm doing, to find the love within it. 

## Sacred Journey
- I was a self-divided, wavering between the self-centered, childlike, instincutal needs of the basic-self, and the logical, robotic, cold detachment of the conscious-self -- out of touch with my higher-self.
- These past years, my mind has constantly smothered my feelings; it had ignored and devalued them. Rather than acknowledge pain and passion felt. Conscious self sweeps it under the rug.
- A great teacher never strives to explain her vision. She simply invites you to stand beside her and see for yourself.
- Plans are useful, but don't get attached. Preparation is always valuable though.
- Zen masters share that all paths -- activities, professions, sports, games, arts, crafts -- serve as a means of internal development, as a boat to get across the river. Once you're across, you don't need the boat anymore.
- I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
- You can't force someone to learn something, you can only show them the way.
- Faith is the courage to live your life as if everything that happens does so for your highest good and learning.
- The warrior needs to master the basic self. Recognize that fear is the worst pain there is. We all die one day. As much as we want to survive, there are things more important than survival, and we must trust that we will learn and grow. The second level is energy. We need to recognize our shame, sorrow, and weaknesses. Our emotions illuminate what we want.
- You must laugh and play to put the basic self at ease, to calm the fear and survival instincts.
- Most things can be solved with awareness. Pay attention to what's right in front of you, deal with what needs to be dealt with, think less.
- There are some mysteries I don't even try to fathom, I just enjoy them.
- In the meantime, just do what feels right, deal with whatever stands in front of you. Use everything to grow, to uplift. Take care of any unfinished business on the lower floors. Face your fears; do whatever you have to do to maximize your health and energy. Channel and discipline that energy: you have to master that self before you can go beyond that self.
- Ultimately, we have no control in this life. We can't stop the waves from crashing down, we can just ride them and use them to grow. Accepting ourselves, our strengths and weaknesses, our foolishness and our love. Accepting everything, doing what we can, and flowing with the rest.

> There is no way to peace,
> peace is the way.
> There is no way to happiness,
> happiness is the way.
> There is no way to love,
> love is the way.
