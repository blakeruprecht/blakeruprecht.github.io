title: The 'Stand that Bit Me

My favorite car as I kid, I had a history book detailing every year. '05 was a big deal for my *nascar* loving *lego* brain. I crashed into one first year of driving.

Pulled up to stoplight leaving Bread Co behind my buddy that I had just hung out with. We were racing out of the parking lot as we always did. I was driving the 4Runner, and pulled the classic *Toyota* error: stepping on the wrong pedal.

Just like that panic a few decades back about cars mysteriously holding down the accelerator... that turned out to be people driving unfamiliar cars and actually just having a skill-issue and holding down the gas pedal thinking it was the brake pedal.

Excuses, excuses. I was terrified to tell my parents, but called my Dad immediately. I'll never forget how calm and chill he was, like I just told him I ate a bagel.

He barely reacted, helped me immediately, told me it was alright. Knew I needed to be calmed down, not disciplined.

He never once blamed me. Whenever I did something, he owned it.
