Walking is fun, and gets me outside consistently. It's the simplest way to travel from A to B, and the most human. I do it every single day. Hell, I do it for fun! Zero equipment needed. Slower than both [cycling](/cycling) and [driving](/driving), but walking gives me more time to observe and relax. Walking is great exercise to maintain cardio, muscles, joints, everything. Especially walking up hills (aka hiking).
