If you can build a box, you can build almost anything out of wood. Heck, a lot of the challenge in woodworking is making the most right right angles possible (yeah, you read that right).

I took shop in middle school and it taught me three things: how to not cut off my finger (unlike my teacher), how to sand for hours by hand, and how to build boxes.

For example, furniture. Most pieces of furniture, besides seating, are boxes. Bed frames, dressers, tables, coffee tables, media consoles, desks, shelves -- all boxes.

What changes from piece to piece then?
- **Size of the box**: length, width, height (X, Y, Z)
- **Number of boxes**: Pay attention in my photos to the arrangement of smaller boxes that comprise bigger boxes.
- **Arrangement**: One box on top of another? Side by side? Perhaps a more complex arrangement?
