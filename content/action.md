- **Action** is something [agents](/agent) do to change their [environment](/environment). It's the only real thing we do. [Thinking](/thinking) is the bodily process of choosing which action to take in every moment.
- **To act is to live.** Living is the process of taking action in every moment. When thinking/acting stops, we die. Sometimes we say we're doing nothing, but we're always doing some actions (e.g. [breathing](/breathing)) until death.
- **Your life is a string of actions.** Every moment is binary: act (1) or don’t (0). 
- **Inaction is decay, entropy, slow death.** Inaction delays pain—but makes it worse. Action is pain now, with purpose. Inaction is random suffering later.
