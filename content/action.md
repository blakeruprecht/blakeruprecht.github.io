Action is choosing. Action is voluntary. Action is the only thing we have -- sure we are the entity that takes the action, we are the entity that decides on the action, and we are the entity that prefers X over Y and decides what is good or bad. We are all of it, but action is all we can do.

It's all we are -- a constant ball of activity. Inactivity is... nothing, death, dying. Wild.

But even when doing nothing, we are still [breathing](Breathing.md).

Action is courage. Bravery. Balls. That's all we have.

Acting in the face of fear, acting even when it's hard, and scary, and painful.



A meditation to myself. 

Responsibility is literally my "response ability". I cannot choose my circumstances, or what the people around me are doing. All I can choose is how I respond. Previously I called this "hell yes or no", but that can be a little confusing. This doesn't mean you have to love every decision you make, or be in love with what you're doing. It just means that taking action is a choice. A choice to move in whatever direction you choose. If you do nothing, you're not stagnating, since entropy exists, the world is changing, and things are happening around you. If you do nothing, you're moving backwards. Away from your goals, away from the people you love.

There is a lot of pain and suffering in this world, and in our own lives. We cannot fix it with one action. All we can do is take a step with each action. A step towards fixing it, or a step towards making it worse. Doing nothing is a step towards making it worse. This is the fundamental realization here. Since time and entropy exist, we *cannot* do nothing and expect things to get better.

Action means facing the pain right now, immediately, head-on, on our own terms. It's blunt and in your face. It forces you to grow. But with it, you can restore order. You can choose where you want to spend your suffering. As you choose this over and over, you gain the strength to keep doing it, and you get better. We are transformed by the pain. The growth and progress we make along the way gives this pain a purpose.

Inaction means putting off the pain until later, when it will be worse, and may even surprise us. It will be random, indiscriminate, and chosen for you. It's a slow-burning poison that drains your will and decays your soul. Everything disintegrates due to entropy, and you'll be helplessly stagnant watching things wither away. You will lose self-respect. You will trade temporary discomfort for long lasting, existential suffering.

Of course, even if you act, the suffering can still hit you at any time. But if you act, you'll be better prepared. We're going to suffer either way. If you do it now, you get to choose the suffering and make it work for you. You can choose to suffer by exercising and build a healthier body to prevent pain later. You can choose to suffer by working hard to build your skills and earn money, rather than having to work for someone else later.

This is probably the only binary lens of life that is legitimately helpful. Computer bits work as an analogy for this. The bit is the smallest possible piece of information, a yes/no question. Our lives exist only in this small moment. So similar to a computer, we are choosing to act (1) or do nothing (0) every moment of our lives. Ideally, our lives look like this: 1111111111. We don't want 0s.

- Derk Sivers. *Hell Yes or No*. Your actions reveal your real values. Your actions show you what you really want. There are two smart responses to this:
	1. Stop lying to yourself, and admit your *real* priorities.
	2. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it's really true.
	- Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment. A bad goal makes you say "I want to do that someday". A great goal makes you take action immediately.
