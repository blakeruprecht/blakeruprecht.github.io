While [walking](/walking) is my preferred mode of [traveling](/traveling), it's by far the slowest. [Cycling](/cycling) is my preferred option for short distances, and [driving](/driving) when I need to go fast or far.

## Bicycles for [cycling](/cycling)
- Any bicycle is pretty much fine
	- Bicycles actually come in different sizes, so for my 1.92 m frame, I typically need a L or XL sized bicycle.
- **Helmets** are essential for not dying in a crash. Looks lame though.
- **Bike Locks** are great to prevent theft when out and about.
- **Headlights/Taillights** are great for night driving, I got ones that flickered to annoy passing cars into not hitting me.
- **Fenders** over the tires can make rain-cycling much more enjoyable.
- **Baskets/Paniers** can enable you to carry gear while biking (e.g. [groceries](/gathering))
- **Trailers** (yes seriously) can enable you haul even more stuff.

## Cars for [driving](/driving)
- **Four seats**: I've had a two-seater sports car before, and that's not enough seats for practical use, but honestly, I rarely cared.
- **Cost = RunningCost * RunTime + PurchasePrice**. If you are comfortable searching for a used car, there is no amount of fuel efficiency that will make up for the cost-savings you can make on purchase price, the single biggest variable of overall car cost.
