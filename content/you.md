For the sake of this website, I'm going to assume that **you** are a human or robot [agent](/agent) in the same [environment](/environment) as me, the [universe](/universe).

This website is part of my ongoing attempt to [communicate](/communicate) some of my [thinking](/thinking) to you using the magic of pictures (in the form of written [language](/language) on my personal [website](/websites)). I hope you enjoy the excessive hyperlinking and half-baked short essays, I'm trying to stop [overthinking](/overthinking) and start [writing](/writing) as little as possible. I don't plan on creating any structure much structure besides the [home page]

So **thank you** for reading this, I truly appreciate any and all time you give to me.

Email me any questions, comments, and arguments you have, I would love to receive an email from **you**.

All my love,
