Here's how to brew cold-brew coffee at home:
1. **Combine** coffee grounds into a jar with water. The grind size should preferably be pretty large, otherwise it takes longer. Buy pre-ground, or grind at home to control the grind size. Use any jar you want, mason jars work great.
2. **Steep** the grounds in the water for 12-24 hours. Overnight is fine. The longer the steep, the stronger the coffee. You can always add water later.
3. **Filter** the coffee and grounds through a filter to remove the grounds. Use any generic coffee filter, a cheese cloth, or a fine mesh filter. They make fine mesh filters that fit in mason jars for this very purpose.
4. **Done**. Time to drink!
