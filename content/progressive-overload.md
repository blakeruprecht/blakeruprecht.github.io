Any exercise causes a growth response. To keep improving, two conditions must be met:
- **Progressive Overload** — The body adapts to repeated stress. To trigger further adaptation, you must increase the stimulus.
    - [lifting](/lifting): increase sets, reps, or weight
    - [running](/running): increase pace, distance, or time under tension
- **Sufficient Recovery** — Adaptation only happens when the body has resources to rebuild.
    - [sleeping](/sleeping): growth happens during deep sleep
    - [eating-anabolic](/eating-anabolic): protein + calories enable growth
    - [drinking](/drinking): hydration aids recovery and performance

## Muscle Adaptations (per muscle)
- **Technique** - more efficient and precise movement
- **Strength** - increased force output
- **Speed** - faster execution of the movement
- **Power** - strength x speed (explosiveness)
- **Endurance** - ability to repeat the movement
- **Size** - hypertrophy

## Energy System Adaptations
- **Anaerobic Endurance** - short bursts (e.g. sprints, heavy lifts)
- **Aerobic Endurance** - sustained, moderate effort (e.g. steady running)
- **Long-Duration Endurance** - multi-hour efficiency (e.g. hiking)
