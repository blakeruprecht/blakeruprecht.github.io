Boxing as spiritual practice. Self-defense. Martial art.

The best reason to learn to fight is so that you never have to.

**Other modalities**
MMA has been a proven ground for fighting styles. One thing is for sure, any one method is insufficient, all the good fighters combine the 3 big styles.
- *Striking* are the main attacks used when standing. Boxing is still the meta for punching, Muay Thai/Kickboxing add in devastating kicks, elbows, knees, and clinches.
- *Wrestling* to control whether the fight stays standing or goes to the ground.
- *Grappling* (e.g. BJJ) for dominance/submission once on the ground.

**Armed**
*Armed* fighting is different, and requires specific training with each weapon. This mainly includes the modern battle rifle and pistol, archery, and spear fighting.
