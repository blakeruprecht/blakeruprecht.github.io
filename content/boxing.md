Boxing is a spiritual discipline. A means of self-mastery. A final resort, never the first. The best fighters train so they never need to fight. The art is restraint backed by overwhelming force.

## Practice
The only martial art I have ever trained. Pure striking. Requires speed, timing, accuracy, conditioning, and control.
- **Conditioning**: [Skip rope](/skipping-rope), [Run](/running), and [Lift](/lifting)
- **Practice**: Heavy bag, Shadowbox, Padwork, Sparring
- **Focus**: [Breathing](/breathing), footwork, head movement, combinations

## Mixed martial arts
MMA has proved that no single discipline is enough -- not even boxing! All serious fighters combine the 3 big styles:
- **Striking** - attacks when standing.
	- *Boxing* - fists
	- *Muay Thai / Kickboxing* - fists, elbows, knees, kicks, clinch
- **Wrestling** - controls transitions from ground->standing and vice versa
	- Offense - takedowns, slams
	- Defense - sprawls, clinch breaks
- **Grappling** - controls dominance/submission on the ground.
	- *Brazilian Jiu Jitsu* - submissions, escapes, dominance

## Armed combat
Different context, requires weapons and specific training with weapons.
- **Rifle** - Modern ranged weapon.
    - Semi-auto, gas-operated, large mag capacity
    - e.g. AR-series, AK-series, sniper rifles, DMRs, LMGs, shotguns
- **Pistol** - Modern melee weapon.
    - Semi-auto, short recoil, polymer frame
    - e.g. Glock, Sig, etc.
- **Bow** - Primitive ranged weapon.
    - Recurve, longbow, compound
    - Silent, skill-intensive, slow rate of fire
    - Alternatives: sling.
- **Spear** - Primitive melee weapon.
	- A sharp stick. Effective in formations or solo.
	- Alternatives: club, tomahawk, sword.
