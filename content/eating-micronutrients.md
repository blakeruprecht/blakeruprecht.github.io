title: Eating micronutrients
---
Micronutrients refer to smaller chemical molecules and just individual atoms the body needs to ingest because we can't create these for nothing. They're part of the raw input to the human body.

15-25 Minerals
13 Vitamins: A, B2, B3, B4, etc.

There are a lot of micronutrients, and it's relatively complicated to remember what micro is in what food, so that's why the general recommendation is to "eat a variety of ingredients." It's kind of a shotgun versus rifle approach. If you got blood work done, or talked to a dietitian, they might be able to perfect your diet.
