Humans eat food for [energy](/eating-calories) first and foremost, but the body is also made of food. Food makes up our bones, organs, heart, lungs, skin, cells, tissues, etc. Everything in a human is made of food. The major building blocks of food/human are called [macronutrients](/eating-macronutrients). Besides the macro chemicals, there are a bunch of tiny chemicals and elements our bodies don't make, but still need to eat to make more body.

There are:
- 15-25 Minerals
- 13 Vitamins: A, B2, B3, B4, etc.

There are a lot of micronutrients, and it's relatively complicated to remember what micro is in what food, so that's why the general recommendation is to "eat a variety of ingredients." It's kind of a shotgun versus rifle approach. If you got blood work done, or talked to a dietitian, they might be able to perfect your diet, but in general, eat a large variety and you'll be okay.
