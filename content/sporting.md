Sports are just fights/competitions with rules. [Fighting](/fighting) is the oldest version of sporting where the first rule was created: *no killing*. From then on out, [sportsmanship](justice.md) has been defined as playing fair according to the rules.

The voluntary limiting of arms. E.g. in soccer, you're not allowed to stab or shoot anyone, even if you want to. Hell, you're not even allowed to tackle! That's what makes it a sport -- there are rules for [fair](justice.md) play.

Basically all sports combine [running](/running), [lifting](/lifting), throwing, and hitting.
