title: Time

Measuring the passage of time is a recognition of death. We don't have forever. We all die, and we can't predict when.

> I'll tell you a secret. Something they don't teach you in your temple. The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.
> - **Achilles** from the movie *Troy*
