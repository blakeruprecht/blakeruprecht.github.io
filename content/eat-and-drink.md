### Energy = balance energy in and energy out
> Bunnies are machines that turn grass into more bunnies.

Humans are biological machines (aka organisms) that use the nutrients found in plant and animal matter to survive, grow, and reproduce (make more humans).

All thanks to nutrients, which is just a fancy name for food & water.

The first way to understand food is understanding that food provides energy for the body. Humans are basically machines that turn food into more humans, just like all the other animals on this earth. To keep operating, we need energy in the form of food. Unfortunately, we can't use solar power directly, we have to indirectly get it by eating plants and animals that have eaten plants and other animals.

### Macros = eat lots of protein, drink lots of water
The second essential thing to understand about food is that it provides nutrients to the body. Nutrients are chemical structures that the body uses to continue operating, building itself, repairing itself, etc. Some of these structures are big molecules like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that are made of Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, and some other elements. Other nutrients (micros) are individual chemical elements (e.g. calcium, iron, often called "minerals" even though they're more than just minerals, smh) or smaller molecules called vitamins, which are also things the body doesn't produce and needs to consume.

**Water** is arguably the most essential macro-nutrient, even though it provides 0 calories of energy (lame! drink beer instead!). Water is essential to all life, and humans are no exception. The general recommendation is to drink as much water as you are thirsty for.

**Proteins** have 4 calories per gram and are essential for building muscles and cells in the body. There are 10 amino acids (types of protein) that the body does not produce and needs to eat.
- All 10 are found in every major type of meat (Chicken, Beef, Pork, Fish, etc.)
- All 10 are found in Beans too, or in Rice, but the proportions of certain amino acids are low in either -- but a combination of beans and rice provides the full 10, in full amounts, just like meat. So eating plant-based is totally okay from a protein standpoint as long as you're mixing your plant-based protein sources.

**Fats** have 9 calories per gram and provide essential material to build cells, protect neurons, etc.
- Unsaturated fat
	- Omega-3: found in most unsaturated fats like Olive Oil, but in lower quantities. Fish are very high in Omega-3s, so that's why people recommend eating fish 2-3x per week or taking a fish oil supplement.
	- Omega-6: found in most unsaturated fats like Olive Oil, in abundance.
- Saturated fat

**Carbohydrates** have 4 calories per gram and provide energy to the body.
- Simple carbs
- Complex carbs
- Fiber -- technically another macro-nutrient, but it doesn't have calories, so who cares. It aids in digestion by providing substance to our poops. Yeah, that's pretty much it, but important to eat. You can also subtract (Fiber (g) x 4 cal/g) from your caloric total because you don't burn fiber, you poop it out.

### Micros = eat a variety of whole foods
15-25 Minerals
13 Vitamins: A, B2, B3, B4, etc.

There are a lot of micronutrients, and it's relatively complicated to remember what micro is in what food, so that's why the general recommendation is to "eat a variety of ingredients." It's kind of a shotgun versus rifle approach. If you got blood work done, or talked to a dietitian, they might be able to perfect your diet.
