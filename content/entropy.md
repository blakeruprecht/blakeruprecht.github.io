I would call it time, but time seems to confuse me.

I have plenty of time.

I cannot argue about the unceasing march of all energy in this universe out into space, eventually distributing all light evenly across the darkness, leaving only a low flicker of light across the universe.

Yeah, you ain't seen nothing yet.


1. Universe starts out pretty homogenous
2. Energy spreads out uniformly
3. Small variations in density leads to gravity doing it's work
4. Gravity pulls together energy into starts, or energy keeps drifting apart
5. Localized stars form so much energy, they start fusing and emitting energy
6. Our universe is born
7. Our universe will die a Heat Death
