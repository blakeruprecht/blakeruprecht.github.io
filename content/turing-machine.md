title: Turing Machine
---
A Turing Machine is relatively simple:
- **Tape** - a long thin piece of paper
- **Markings** - on the tape which tell the machine to go left or right
- **Machine** - that reads the markings and moves the tape accordingly

Turing proved in the 1940s that such a simple machine could realistically calculate the solution to any math problem in the world. With that mathematical proof (nerd paper), he invented the modern computer.
