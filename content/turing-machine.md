Summary of the Turing Machine

- We can program a machine to function as a Turing Machine
	- In-depth explanation of Turing Machines, why they're so important, and how all modern computers are Turing Machines
	- Basically, machines that can hold numbers, and manipulate numbers (even just 1s and 0s), can functionally computer almost anything in the world with abstraction

## The Ancient Texts

## Lovelace, Babbage, and thinking machines

## Goedel, Turing, and the great Theory of Computing
- The theories started in, you guessed it, [math](Euler.md)
- Incompleteness, and why this matters
- The revolutionary discovery by the 17 yr old wiz kid from England, Turing
- What can we use as tape?
- How do we manipulate the tape?

## von Neumann and The Big ol' Boys
- Beginning of computers, von Neumann architecture
- Development of memory
- Powering these puppies
- Original size x power ratios (to compare advances across this post)
- Original programs, programming languages, scripts, how does that shit all start?
- LISP, beginnings of AI

## Personal Computing
- Getting smaller
- Windows vs. Apple, Apple's 1984 ad
- How do programs evolve?
- More updates, how does AI co-evolve with this?

## Computers go mobile
