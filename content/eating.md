I eat 3000 calories per day to maintain my energy, 150 g Protein per day to maintain my muscle, and a wide Variety of ingredients to maintain my micronutrient levels. I eat 3 meals per day.
- [Gathering](/gathering) whole ingredients throughout the week
- *Breakfast*: [smoothie](/smoothie)
- *Lunch*: [lunchbox](/lunchbox) or [salad](/salad)
- *Dinner*: [cooking](/cooking) something from my personal [menu](/menu)

## Energy
Food is fuel for [living](/living). Get a rough estimate of how much you need daily with a [TDEE calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/). Use a scale to measure weight gain/loss, and adjust caloric intake based on that. Drinking calories is easier than chewing them. Calorie/meal timing doesn't matter.
- IN = OUT → maintain
- IN > OUT → gain weight
- IN < OUT → lose weight

## Macronutrients
Large chemical molecules we need in bulk to provide energy and structure for the body. The bones, organs, muscles, skin, cells, brain, etc were all once food.
- **Protein** (4 cal/g): builds muscle, cells, tissue. *Most important macro*. Get from meat or any grain+legume combo for a complete amino acid profile.
- **Fats** (9 cal/g): builds cells, hormones, nerves. Only omega-3 and 6 unsaturated fats are essential for the human body.
    - *Omega-3*: found in fish, flax, walnuts, and small amounts in olive oil.
    - *Omega-6*: found in all veggie oils and seeds, e.g. olive oil.
- **Carbs** (4 cal/g): main energy source. Technically not essential, but useful.
    - *Fiber* (0 cal/g): aids digestion, has no calories.
- **Alcohol** (7 cal/g): non-essential, gets burned first.
- **Water** (0 cal/g): okay, actually the most important macronutrient since humans are mostly water, but there's a whole note about [drinking](/drinking)

## Micronutrients
Small chemical molecules and elements we need in certain amounts because the body can't make them. Too complex to memorize. Just eat diverse whole foods. Here's a good list:
- Plants
	- *Leaves*: spinach, kale, romaine, spring mix
	- *Herbs*: cilantro, basil, rosemary, thyme
	- *Crucifers*: broccoli, cabbage
	- *Roots*: carrot, sweet potato, garlic, onion, ginger
	- *Citrus*: lemon, lime, tomato, oranges, pineapple, chili peppers
	- *Berries*: banana, blueberry, blackberry, kiwi, avocado
	- *Fungi*: mushrooms, nutritional yeast
	- *Legumes*: beans, lentils, tofu, edamame
	- *Nuts*: cashews, almonds, walnuts, pistachios
	- *Seeds*: sunflower, sesame, chia, hemp, flax
	- *Grains*: pasta, rice, oats, corn, bread, tortilla
	- *Oils*: olive oil, veggie oil
	- *Spices*: kosher salt, whole black pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin, turmeric
	- *Condiments*: salsa, hot sauce, hummus, mustard, sauerkraut
	- *Drinks*: water, coffee, tea
- Animals
	- *Poultry*: eggs, chicken, turkey
	- *Fish*: tuna, salmon, trout
	- *Red Meat*: beef, pork, bison, rabbit, liver
	- *Dairy*: yogurt, milk, cheese, butter

## Anabolism
The state of the body where it is capable of building muscle. In to do this, the body requires a few things:
- [Sleeping](/sleeping) plenty each night (this is where muscle is built)
- [Drinking](/drinking) plenty of water each day
- **Eating** a surplus of *energy* and *protein*, and plenty of micronutrients
- [Lifting](/lifting) to progressively overload the muscles
