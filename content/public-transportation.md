It's pretty much the same process for all public transportation world-wide (at least USA, Europe, Asia)
1. Buy your ticket
	- **Taxis**: use an app like Uber/Lyft, hail a cab, call a number
	- **Busses/Trains/Boats**: show up slightly early and buy a ticket from the kiosk, either on the bus, at the train station, or at the boat dock.
	- **Airplanes**: purchase online >3 weeks before the flight. By far the most expensive and difficult tickets to purchase world-wide.
2. Show up at the specified time and location, hop on, and chill out.
