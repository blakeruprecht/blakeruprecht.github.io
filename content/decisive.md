- **Decisive = Choosing action despite fear.** It’s the will to move forward in the face of death, uncertainty, or resistance.
- **Fear is natural.** It comes from mortality, the unknown, and opposition—but must be faced.
- **Decisiveness is kinetic.** It’s speed, energy, and the shrinking of the gap between thought and action.
- **Time is precious.** Courage means not wasting it. Regret is worse than risk.
- **Act now.** The best goals change your present behavior, not just your future plans. Judge a [goal](/policy) by how well it gets you to take [action](/action) in the present moment.
- **Your actions reveal your truth.** If you're not acting on it, maybe it's not your real priority.
- **Grit = Endurance with purpose.** Stick with the hard thing, especially when it aligns with your values.
- **Decision obeys wisdom.** It’s not reckless. It listens to reason, acts when needed, and holds the line.
