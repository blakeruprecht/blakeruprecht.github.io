Cycling is the most efficient non-mechanized form of [traveling](/traveling) for [humans](/humans). A human with a bicycle is more efficient than:
- A California Condor soaring through the sky
- A Horse running over the plains
- A Tuna fish swimming in the ocean

The only required tool for cycling is a [bicycle](/bicycle) and whatever accessories you choose (e.g. a helmet, lock, etc.), or a different form of rolling around like a unicycle, tricycle, scooter, skateboard, rollerblade, etc, but these are all less efficient than a bicycle.
