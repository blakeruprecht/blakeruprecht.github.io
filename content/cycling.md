- **WHO**: Me
- **WHEN**: [traveling](/traveling) short distances
- **WHERE**: [outside](/outside)
- **HOW**:
	0. Tools: [clothes](/clothes), [bicycle](/bicycle)
	1. Bicycle on the roads, use hand signals, avoid getting hit
	2. Lock-up bike wherever you go

## Why
- Fun, love the wind in my hair and on my face, getting outside is awesome.
- Cycling is the most efficient non-mechanized form of [traveling](/traveling) for [humans](/humans). A human with a bicycle is more efficient than:
	- A California Condor soaring through the sky
	- A Horse running over the plains
	- A Tuna fish swimming in the ocean
- The only required tool for cycling is a [bicycle](/bicycle) and whatever accessories you choose (e.g. a helmet, lock, etc.), or a different form of rolling around like a unicycle, tricycle, scooter, skateboard, rollerblade, etc, but these are all less efficient than a bicycle.
