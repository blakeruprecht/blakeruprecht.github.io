At the scale of the universe, what matters? Nothing from a humans perspective, that's for sure, besides the potential threat of another planet hitting us, a black hole swallowing us up, or a random burst of energy acting like a galactic laser beam straight to our little rock.

The probability of an astrophysics-related catastrophe here on earth is probably 1%.


The scale of life is so huge

## Cosmic scale -- pale blue dot

## The whole universe in a glass of wine

## It only adds!
