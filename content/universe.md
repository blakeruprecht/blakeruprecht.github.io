title: Universe

My [environment](/environment) is the entire universe, all of everything, reality.


## Cosmic scale -- pale blue dot
I am a bunch of electrical connections which animate jelly held in a sack of skin surrounding calcified rocks which can move.

I live on a big rock hurtling millions of miles per hour through a backwater of space.

My entire home is simple a mote of dust caught suspended in a sunbeam.

## The whole universe in a glass of wine

## It only adds!
