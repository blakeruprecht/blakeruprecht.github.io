At the scale of the universe, what matters? Nothing from a humans perspective, that's for sure, besides the potential threat of another planet hitting us, a black hole swallowing us up, or a random burst of energy acting like a galactic laser beam straight to our little rock.

The probability of an astrophysics-related catastrophe here on earth is probably 1%.


The scale of life is so huge

## Cosmic scale -- pale blue dot
I am a bunch of electrical connections which animate jelly held in a sack of skin surrounding calcified rocks which can move.

I live on a big rock hurtling millions of miles per hour through a backwater of space.

My entire home is simple a mote of dust caught suspended in a sunbeam.

## The whole universe in a glass of wine

## It only adds!
