I'm already good enough.
I have more than enough.

I have a healthy, fit, athletic body.
I have a sharp, intelligent, skilled mind.
I have a positive, grateful, focused spirit.

I am surrounded by loving family and friends.

I have voice to talk to loved ones
I have air to breathe
I have energy to move
I have food to eat
I have water to drink and clean
I have shelter to sleep in
I have tools to work with
