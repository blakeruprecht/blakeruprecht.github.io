title: Skipping Rope
---
I train my cardio sometimes by skipping rope. It's a fun way to practice balance, coordination, and rhythym. It's fantastic for cardio training, and also improves the calf and shoulder muscles, as well as the core.

I usually skip for 10-20 minutes. I started out by just doing 10 minutes every time and trying to do 100 skips each minute, and then resting the rest of the minute. Eventually, I have been able to add other types of skipping to my routine, and have made it more free flowing, but there's no rules -- just bouncing up and down for 10 minutes will accomplish all of the magic.
