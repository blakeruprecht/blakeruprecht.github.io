## The Way, the Tao

## It's the same with computers

## They follow steps, that's what code is
A series of instructions to go from INPUT to OUTPUT.

All code is a series of instructions

Anything can be a computer

Starting from Binary code (1s and 0s)
To machine code which does math on binary (XOR, AND, etc)
To languages which create functions that abstract on top of logic
To programs which abstract using languages and output devices like screens to display pictures
To programs which run huge [How-to-symbolize-any-relationship](How-to-symbolize-any-relationship.md)  trained using [How-AI-improves-from-experience](How-AI-improves-from-experience.md)

Remembering back to how Turing learned to [turing-machine](turing-machine.md)
