Sleep is important for everything, I just don't know exactly what. Sleep for roughly 8 hours per night, but this number is unique to each person. Maintain cool temperatures in your sleeping room with plenty of blankets to get comfortable. [Sunlight](sunlight.md) is the main mechanism for waking up the body, and darkness is the main mechanism for telling the body to sleep. Wake a consistent time to set a sleep schedule and go to sleep when your body naturally feels tired.

1. Wake at a consistent time and view sunlight for 10+ mins (more if overcast)
2. Sleep when tired

- Sunlight is the mechanism that signals the bodies natural wake/sleep rhythym. Bright sunlight upon waking (10-30 mins in duration,  regardless of time of day) signals the body to wake up at that same time the next day. More sunlight throughout the day, especially around sunset, helps this process.
- Darkness at night (e.g. after sunset) helps the body wind-down for sleep. E.g. don't use bright overhead lights at night.
