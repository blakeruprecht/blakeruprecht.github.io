PRACTICE
- **Wake** at a consistent time, e.g. 8:00 AM
- **Sleep** when tired each night

RESOURCES
- TIME: 6-10 hours per night
- MONEY: [Budget-Rent](/budget)
- TOOLS: Shelter, Mattress, Blankets, Pillow, AlarmClock
- ENVS: [HOME_BEDROOM](/home), [PACK_SHELTER](/pack)

Wake at a consistent time and view [sunlight](/sunlight) for 10+ minutes. Sunlight is the main mechanism for waking the body, so this will make it easier to wake at that time. IN addition, view as much sunlight as possible throughout the day to improve wakefulness, and also help make you tired later. Avoid bright lights after sunset. 

Sleep when tired in a bedroom/shelter that is **dark**, relatively **cool**, has a softish mattress, and multiple **blankets** to layer on/off throughout the night. If you set a consistent wakeup time, you'll start to sleep naturally for however long your individual body needs. This also works with a consistent sleep time and variable wake time.

Sleep is important for pretty much every bodily function. It's a big reset for the body.
