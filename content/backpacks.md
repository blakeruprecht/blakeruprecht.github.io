## Onebag for city travel
- Backpack28L, Daypack16L (packed in main bag)
- Smartphone, Wallet/IDs/Passport/Documents, Chargers
- Dopp bag, Glasses, case, contacts, solution, Toothbrush, paste, floss
- Shower bag, Beard Trimmer, Pack Towel, soap, deodorant
- Clothes bag, Tshirt(2), Boxer(2), Socks(2), Shorts(2), Sandals, Shell, Puffer, Ballcap
- (+) Notebook, Pen, Laptop, Earbuds, Earplugs, Water bottle, Skip rope, Rings

I traveled the world with my school backpack and some stuff I had lying around. All those travel lists are stupid and full of overpriced gear. The only things I purchased specifically for travel are a dopp bag (a pencil pouch) to keep my sink toiletries in, an eagle creek clothes bag, travel soap (dr bronners), and a packable towel. The shower bag is just the pouch my beard trimmer came in.

I don't bring many clothes. This list assumes that I'm already wearing a tshirt, pants, boxers, socks, and sneakers, maybe a hoodie if it's cold outside. This way, with the shell and puffer, I can layer with the hoodie and be comfy in well below freezing temps. I wash my tshirts, boxers, and socks in the shower with me and let them air dry, so they're always fresh. Sandals and shorts are a necessity anywhere the weather goes above room temperature.

Anything with a (+) is an optional luxury, I took all of these crazy luxuries but you may not need as much fluff as me. I actually didn't take gymnastics rings, but have made room in my bag for next time -- sometimes it's hard to find a good pullup bar.

## Rucksack for wild travel
- Rucksack55L
- Tent, Quilt, Pad, Pillow, Cordage
- Water Filter, Bottles(2)
- Ferro, lighter, matches, Pot 750ml, Stove, fuel
- Headlamp, Compass, maps
- (+) Knife, Axe
- (+) Fishing Pole, Tackle, Net, Clippers, Forceps
- (+) Bow and Arrows

For any camping trip, I tend to bring the same items as for world travel, at least lines 2, 3, 4, and 5 (the phone, legal stuff, dopp, shower, & clothes bags), maybe some luxuries.

I have a cheap tent/quilt/pad combo from walmart, it's decent, and actually packs decently small. Sawyer mini filter and smart bottles from the gas station. Tons of ways to start fire, that's important, and a soto amicus pot and stove combo.
