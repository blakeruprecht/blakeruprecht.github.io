The System emerged from Wittenberg, Germany in the 1500s. We can still see correlation between distance from Wittenberg and literacy rates. Why Germany, of all places, and why then?

The human population left Africa, and as naturally does when populations spread out, it went from heterogenous to homogenous. In Europe and the Middle East, the human populations were somewhat different, but not as different as in Africa itself. Farther out, in India and China, the populations were more homogeneous, leading to more successful empires. Until all that difference lead to so much fighting between Europe and the Middle East. The Greeks fought the Persians. The Romans fought the Persians. Everyone fought the barbarian Tatars from the steppe.

The lands north of Rome were conquered by the Germanic tribes. These were massive, varied groups of people that were constantly battling for survival.

My theory is that Germany became the center of fighting, so to speak, and forced culture to evolve more rapidly. Protestantism introduced literacy to the population, and shifted the value from the collective tribe (like the European south, still evidenced today by strong Spanish/Italian/Greek/Croatian family ties), and shifted the importance to the individual and the nuclear family.

That center was quickly adopted by the British, who were every bit as good at fighting as the Germans, but much more polite for some reason.

And then that center shifted to America, the land of opportunity.
