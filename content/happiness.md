Wisdom goes beyond science, and is about more than just winning. True wisdom is the pursuit of living well, which for most people, means being happy and brining happiness to others. How? 

## Happiness
> Happiness = Setpoints + Conditions + Voluntary actions

Happiness is our overall positive feeling about our lives. From the happiness research I have read, this mostly is a subjective rating, 0-10 or something like that.

## Setpoints 
The biological basis of human happiness is our neurochemical setpoints, which is the resting level of things like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, etc in the brain. They are mostly genetic and very hard to change. If these are or get out of whack, there are only three scientifically proven interventions to fix them:
- *Medication*: precribed by a Psychiatrist, medication designed to specifically alter brain chemicals.
- *Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy*: The most highly regarded type of therapy which helps us identify our cognitive biases and distortions (untruths) and correct them to alter our brain chemistry.
- [*Meditation*](_NOTES/Breathing.md): I'm not joking, meditation is literally one of the most powerful actions we have for improving our mental health, since it helps cut through thinking and regulate our physiological baseline.

## Conditions
The enduring, but not permanent, factors of our life like our jobs, where we live, and the environmental problems we face in day to day life. 

The research shows that negative conditions can really impact our happiness, but positive conditions don't affect it much. Think about it like this -- the brain would much rather remove some pain from life than add in some new pleasures. Fixing an annoying leaky faucet or moving away from toxic neighbors does a lot more than upgrading to a luxury car for our happiness.

## Actions
Our response to our setpoints and conditions often.

The only thing in our control
- Stoicism
- Zen Buddhism
- Taoism
- Growth Mindset

This refers to the things we choose to do daily. Outside of the conditions of our life like our jobs and homes, we have a lot of choice each day -- what to eat, when to sleep, how to take care of ourselves, what exercise and hobbies to do, who to hangout with, and more. The most important voluntary actions for human happiness are not very surprising:
- **Relationships** with other people. These are so important, they get their own section at [[_IDEAS#Relationship]]
- **Flow** activities are challenging enought to engage us, but not frustrate us, and interesting enough to keep us involved. You know you're flowing when you lose track of time. In a way, it's the active form of meditation

Mindset
- **Belief** that you deserve to walk your path
- **Moderation/Harmony** to experience the path fully
- **Courage** to face any challenge along the path
- **Wisdom** take one step at a time to follow your path

## Flow, the Process, and Growth Mindset
**Summary**: Change your mindset to prioritize growth by praising yourself for effort, hard-work, and learning. Talk to yourself like a friend, don't try to be perfect, and engage in positive self-talk. Eventually, you will be making more progress than you ever were with a fixed mindset.


**Growth mindset** is when you believe you can improve at anything with time and effort. 
Instead of seeing challenges as an internal problem, you see them as a chance to get better and improve. When facing challenges, you get excited about the *learning process*. This mentality makes you less likely to quit, and much more likely to hit your goals. Basically, challenge your beliefs about yourself, and switch your *fixed mindset* (e.g. I'm slow, mediocre at lifting, stupid at writing) to a *growth mindset* (e.g. I can get faster, I try hard at dating, I'm learning how to write).

## Praise effort, not identity
Scientists did a study on kids, and basically split them up into two groups.
- The first group was praised for their identity, e.g. "You're intelligent and smart", "You're so talented"
- The second group was praised for their effort, e.g. "You're trying your best", "It's nice how you didn't give up".

They found the second group was more likely to try, to persist, and to succeed. When you get identity-based feedback, you focus on preserving that identity. You keep working to stay smart and talented, so these students chose easier problems to solve. 

When you get effort-based feedback, you attach the praise to the effort itself. You are more willing to work hard and make mistakes. So these children chose harder problems and kept improving over time.

The clear takeaway is to praise *effort* towards goals, and remove thoughts related to identity. I am no longer smart, I am a *hard worker* who *persists* towards my goals and *doesn't give up*, regardless of outcome.

Examples:
- This code still isn't working, but I've sat here for three hours *trying* to fix it.
- I'm not rich yet, but I'm working hard to make it happen.
- I'm still single, but I'm putting myself out there.
- My muscles are weak, but I'm working out hard three times a week.

## Stop trying to be perfect
Fixed mindset people feel like failure is an attack on their identity. Growth people don't mind errors, in fact, *they enjoy them*. They become curious, and start thinking of ways to solve the problem.

Stop beating yourself up. You're not perfect. Engage in *positive self-talk*, where you don't make identity statements about yourself (e.g. never again say "I'm stupid", "I'm incapable", or any other negative bullshit like that), and focus only on solving the problem. You may not get it at first, but since you're now a *growth mindset person* focused on effort and improving, it's only a matter of time until you conquer this challenge.

## Embrace stress 
The final part of growth mindset, a difficult addition, is the view that "stress is enhancing". Discomfort during effort means that your brain is experiencing neuroplasticity, which literally means your brain will grow and get better. The stressful emotions show that your effort is *paying off*. So instead of quitting anything that feels stressful, remember that stress is proof that you are improving.

There are some great techniques to embrace and deal with stress in the moment to keep moving forward, many gleaned from the Navy SEALs.

- **Breathwork** allows us to control our mental state using physical tricks. We can hack our brains to reduce anxiety and calm ourselves down by doing breathing techniques like *deep physiological sighs*, which are shown to be just as effective as meditation for calming down the mind.
- **Visualization** is a great way to generate instant motivation. Do it by vividly picturing where you want to get to, and then immediately comparing it with where you are now. The mental contrasting should generate motivation to take action and improve.
- **Positive self-talk** is crucial. What we tell our selves often becomes our reality. You might as well, it will clearly benefit your life, improve your mood, with almost no downsides. Because if you say you'll fail, then it's pretty much impossible to ever succeed.
- **Micro-goals** are a great trick to keep moving forward. Instead of looking at the big picture, break your goals down into the smallest possible chunks to focus only on what's right in front of you. Basically, take life one step at a time.
