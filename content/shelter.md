Humans can survive roughly 3 minutes without oxygen. We survive roughly 3 hours without warmth, so it's a major survival priority, above water and food (which also help keep humans warm).

The first way to maintain warmth in the body is to [move](/move). Moving the body will inevitably heat you up, but it is not sufficient in many environments, including anywhere it's really cold. For long-term survival, shelter is necessary to provide humans with warmth, as well as safe places to rest and sleep.
