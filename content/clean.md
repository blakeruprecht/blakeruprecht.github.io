## Eyes
The dominant human sense is vision. Therefore, the eyeballs are extremely important to your overall success and well-being. People survive while blind, sure, but nobody denies that life is simpler with vision.

**Wear corrective glasses/contacts**. These actually help improve eye health by stopping degeneration where it's at. Squinting and straining the eyes only makes vision problems worse.

**Regularly change eye focal length**. Move your focus from something CLOSE to you to something FAR away from you, then to something in the MIDDLE. Try to shift your focal length every 20 minutes or so, and practice adjusting your eyes from short, to medium, to long distance objects. This will help exercise and stretch out your eyeballs to prevent them getting worse.

**Wear sunglasses**. Probably the most important thing to do to prevent wear and tear on the ol' wet balls.

## Teeth
The mouth is our first line of defense agains the food we eat and many other things. Keeping it healthy is essential for overall health.

**Brush teeth twice daily**.

**Floss daily**. The other essential part of teethcare, everybody's least favorite. Non-optional though.

## Skin
It's our first line of defense, and honestly, my skin tone (European 46th Latitude) was not evolved for the location I'm living (American 38th Latitude), so I have to take steps to protect it from the elements. My family has a history of skin cancer, so this is doubly true for me.

**Wear sunscreen daily**. UV rays are hamrful to the skin. I get small skin carcinomas every year that need to be removed. Wear it on your face daily, since that portion of skin is always exposed to the sun (neck too).

**Moisturize daily**. I don't remember why.

**Cleansers**. Clean your face everyday.

**Shower daily**. Hop in the water and rinse off, clean the entire body, use some super chill soap to not fuck with your skin. Go easy on the products, go easy on the heat. Cold water is amazing for the body, that's all I'll say -- don't fear it. Warm water is fucking amazing too, I love a hot tub/spring/shower as much as the next animal.

## Hair
The ol' shave and shower. I don't believe in all the modern marketing mumbo-jumbo. Here's what I do to protect my luscious gray-brown locks:

**Wash daily with water**. Look, all that shampoo crap is BS if you ask me. I use water, and most of the time some soap. Typically bar soap or 2in1 or 3in1. I would prefer to use something natural and just let my hair go natural, but I haven't investiagted that yet.

**Shave beard and body hair daily**. I'm part Neanderthal (no, really), so I need to shave the coat that grows over my entire body off every few weeks. It's easier to maintain with an almost daily schedule. The hairy struggle is real. My beard needs constant maintenance, which is a struggle to love as well. Not to mention my hair.

**Cut hair once per month**. That's a reasonable amount of time, but I normally do two month gaps depending on how lazy I am. I use a 1 and 2 (1/8", 1/4") for the sides, and start in the back of the top with an 8 (1") and then taper the length to longer in the front. I like scultping, so it's pretty fun.
