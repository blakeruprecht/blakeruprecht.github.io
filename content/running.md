Running is fun. You can run 3 x/week (e.g. TuThSa) slowly and be fit for life. Go fast sometimes if you want. [Add speed or distance](/progressive-overload) to improve.

1. Run two miles at Zone 2 pace. 

- Zone 1: [walking](/walking), still fun!
- Zone 2: easy pace (nose-breathing)
- Zone 3-4: tempo/intervals 
- Zone 5: sprints
