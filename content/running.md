Running is my chosen movement to train my **cardio**. It feels good, primal, and natural. I enjoy getting outside, listening to the birds, seeing the plants, [sunlight](/sunlight), and feeling my lungs and muscles working. I don't run for distance or speed, I run for the strain and joy. Running keeps my heart strong, my body enduring, my mind sharp, and my spirit alive.

Most of my runs are two miles at zone 2 (nose breathing) pace, so that I slowly improve over time. I'll run faster (tempo/intervals) once every week or two, maybe less or more. Sometimes I'll sprint at the end of runs, I may increase that to 1x/week in the future.

**Cardio zones**
- Zone 1: [walking](/walking), still fun!
- Zone 2: easy pace (nose-breathing)
- Zone 3-4: tempo/intervals
- Zone 5: sprints

**Progressive overload** for endurance, stamina (cardio).
- Run faster (e.g. tempo runs or interval runs)
- Run longer
- Run more often
