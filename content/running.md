Running is my chosen movement to train my **cardio**. It feels good, primal, and natural. I enjoy getting outside, listening to the birds, seeing the plants, [sunlight](/sunlight), and feeling my lungs and muscles working. I don't run for distance or speed, I run for the strain and joy.

Most of my runs are two miles at zone 2 (nose breathing) pace. Sometimes I go faster or longer to progressively overload my system, but only when I feel great.

Cardio zones
- Zone 1: [walking](/walking), still fun!
- Zone 2: easy pace (nose-breathing)
- Zone 3-4: tempo/intervals
- Zone 5: sprints

The only way to improve cardio endurance is to progressively overload the body
- Run faster (e.g. tempo runs or interval runs)
- Run longer
- Run more often
