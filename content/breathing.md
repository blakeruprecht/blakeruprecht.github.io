- [Earthbending](/earthbending): Breathe. Look at where you are. Feel your feet, your body, your breath. You are already enough.
- [Airbending](/airbending): Now ask yourself: what do I want right now? Ignore everything else. Choose what you desire.
- [Waterbending](/waterbending): Whatever it is -- give it your full attention. Focus wholeheartedly.
- [Firebending](/firebending): Just do it. Doesn't matter what it is. Move with courage.

Drop the analysis, the overthinking. No perfect planning, no perfect theory. Just [living](/living). You don't need to prove anything. You get to choose every action. Commit to it all in. And just go, through the fear, through the pain.

## The Sword
Meditation is a technique for slashing your thoughts.

It's sometimes called a state of non-action, but this is not true, since you're still breathing! What is true is that you're not doing anything else, or once you are a pro, you're doing at most one thing will full focus and attention.

So the goal of meditation isn't to *stop* thinking -- that's impossible!

Instead, think of meditation as a sword which can cut throught the *spaghetti loops* of thoughts in your head. All those thoughts easily get jumbled up, and each one vies for your attention, claiming it's the most important thought.

Thoughts take us out of the present moment. They make us think about the past or future, two places which only exist in our minds.

Whatever you start thinking about, whether it be your surroundings, people in your life, what you're doing later, the whole point is to notice you're thinking about something, slash that thought with the sword of "Not right now", and let that thought drift away out of your conscious mind.

Return your focus to your breathing/the present moment.

Then, the next thought comes in. Something different, maybe about burgers this time. Who cares, slash that thought and let it drift away.
