One moment, one breath, in through the nose, out through the mouth. Every breath returns you to the present.

BREATHING TECHNIQUES
- **Zen** - sit tall, relax, open shoulders, breathe naturally
- **Box** - 4s inhale, 4s hold, 4s exhale, 4s hold -- repeat
- **Slow** - extend each inhale and exhale as long as possible

PRACTICE BREATHING
- Practice the art of focusing by picking something easy to focus on -- the breath. You always have it with you, never goes away, etc.
- When focus wanders, return it to your breathing cycle, in and out.
- Repeat over and over *(this is the practice, that's all it is)*
- Focusing is a **sword** that slashes through the spaghetti-loop of [thoughts](/thinking). Don't try to untangle the loop of thoughts. Slash it to ribbons.

MY PRACTICE
1. **Ground and look around** - The ground beneath my feet. The fresh air all around me. Clouds, rains, and rivers. The sun in the sky. Fires. Wild plants. Trees. Oaks. Food plants, chilis, onion, garlic, wheat, barley. Medicine plants. Bacteria and the tiny animals. Wild fish. Trout. Tuna. Insects. Amphibians. Reptiles. Birds. Crows. Hawks. Eagles. Songbirds. Big thanks to Chicken. Mammals. Squirrels. Deer. Wolves. Bears. Pigs. Horses. Big thanks to Cow. Big thanks to Cat and Dog. All of humanity. My people. This moment.
