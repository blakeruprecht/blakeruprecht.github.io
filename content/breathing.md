One moment, one breath, in through the nose, out through the mouth. Every breath returns you to the present

TECHNIQUES
- **Zen** - sit tall, relax, open shoulders, breathe naturally
- **Box** - 4s inhale, 4s hold, 4s exhale, 4s hold -- repeat
- **Slow** - extend each inhale and exhale as long as possible

MEDITATION
- The art of focusing
- Focus on your breath
- When focus wanders, return it to your breath
- Repeat over and over *(this is the practice, that's all it is)*
