- **Will**: Desire to keep [living](/living) means desire to take action.
- **Action**. Life is action. Regret is worth than risk. You can recover from mistakes, you can't undo nothing. Action is living, inaction is a slow death.
- **Kinetic**: Action expresses truth. Thought, dreams, intentions are all potential energy, not real until acted upon. If you're not taking action, then it isn't real.
- **Endurance**: Keep going even when it gets hard, when you get tired, when things aren't easy.
- **Speed**: [Time](/time) is our limiting resource. Go faster and reduce the time between thought and action. Act before you think yourself out of it.
- ***Memento mori***. You're going to die. That truth should set you on fire, not shut you down. Every action is either aligned with death, or defiant against it. Death gives us context, it turns every moment into a question -- what would this mean if this were my last? *Carpe diem*.
- **Courage**: Keep taking action even when you're afraid. Life is scary -- death, fear, uncertainty, failure, etc. Courage means acting anyway and continuing to live with the fear.

- *Action is the path*. Knowing means nothing without doing. Act without hesitation. "A warrior acts; only a fool reacts."
- *Surrender the outcome.* “You don't have to control everything—you just have to do your best.” Train hard, give fully, then let go. The results aren't yours.
- *Discipline and surrender coexist.* Train like a monk, move like a fighter, rest like a child. Strength without aggression. Surrender without weakness.
- *Service and purpose over ego.* Your life is not about proving yourself. It’s about waking up—becoming a force of presence, clarity, and love in action.
- *The warrior’s strength is internal.* Not control over others. But control over the only battlefield that matters: yourself.
