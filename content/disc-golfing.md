Disc Golf is hella fun and incredibly chill. It's a drinking sport! Usually free to play, and you only actually need a single disc, which costs about $10, and will last every throw up until you lose it!

In three years, I went from a consistent +9-18 bogey player, to occasionally shooting under par (-3, -1, -1) and getting birdies. I've gotten one ace! I'm not saying I'm that good, I play with absolute turkeys who throw -8, and drive 500 feet.

## How to Play (the fundamentals)

Tools - you need one disc, the best single disc is a Midrange Driver.

Envs - a basket, or a *Disc Golf Course* with baskets, to shoot at

Process - for each hole:
1. **Drive**: Throw the disc straight and far from the pad.
2. Upshots: Usually either a short drive, or a long putt.
3. **Putt**: Use putting form to throw the disc straight at the basket.

## Upgrades

You only technically need one disc, but a putter is pretty important, and once you can throw your first disc far, get faster discs to increase your skill ceiling.
- **Putter** - As soon as possible.
- **Fairway Driver** - Once you can overthrow your midrange.
- **Distance Driver** - Once you can overthrow your fairway.
