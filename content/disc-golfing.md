Disc Golf is fun. It's played at courses that are usually free. It's a great sport to drink and smoke during.

1. Chill out a bit.
2. Get up there and rip it.

Discs to use:
1. **Midrange**. The most useful disc for all shots in disc golf.
2. **Putter**. Good to improve your up-close putting consistency.
3. **Fairway Driver**. First driver to add, for 300+ ft shots.
4. **Distance Driver**. Very hard to throw, only use if you can overthrow a fairway.

Disc Numbers A/B/C/D
- A = [1,14] **Speed** you must throw for proper flight.
- B = [1,7] **Glide**, how long the disc stays in the air.
- C = [-5,1] **Turn**, how much it will go right on a RHBH shot
	- -5 = *Understable*, it'll turn hard
	- -1-0 = *Stable*
	- +1 = *Overstable*, it'll resist turning
- D = [0,5] **Fade**, once the disc slows down, how hard will it cut to the left
