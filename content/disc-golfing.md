Disc Golf is fun. It's played at courses that are usually free. It's a great sport to drink and smoke during.

1. Chill out a bit.
2. Get up there and rip it.

- You don't need a million discs to play, just 1. Start with a midrange for everything, add a putter to improve your close game, add a fairway driver for drives over 300 feet, and finally, add a distance driver once you have the skill and speed to throw one.
	- *Midrange*: The go-to disc for driving and every long shot. I played with just these two discs for years, until I got to the point where I could throw my midrange (5 speed) 300+ feet. 
		- If I played with just one disc, it would be this one.
	- *Putter*: The best way I've improved my game has been getting better at hitting putts within 30 feet. 
	- *Fairway Driver* - The first upgrade to make is a faster driver for 300+ foot drives. I threw my first fairway driver into a lake and didn't throw another for two years.
	- *Distance Driver* - Very fun to throw and get max distance. Need a lot of skill and arm speed to throw these.
- Stable, overstable, understable -- just play with your discs to figure out how they fly, this stuff gets really complicated.
