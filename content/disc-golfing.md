Disc golf is an easy, accessible version of golf typically played at free courses, accompanied by user's choice of [beer](/beer) and [weed](/weed).

## Disc Golf discs
The discs don't matter nearly as much as you might think, seeing people walk around with big bags full of 20+ discs. You really only need 1 to start (a putter), but you can add faster discs as you get better at throwing.
- **Putter** - Mainly for short distance accuracy shots. Getting good at putting within 30 feet is one of the best upgrades any player can make for their game.
- **Midrange Driver** - Easiest driver to throw, can get 300+ feet.
- **Fairway Driver** - Harder to throw, goes farther than midrange.
- **Distance Driver** - Very hard to throw, but can go the farthest.

When I was new to disc golf, I just stuck with a Putter and a Midrange for a long time, playing with only those two discs and getting really good at throwing the Midrange far and straight. Once I could do this reliably, I added a Fairway driver to my bag, and have only recently added a Distance driver after throwing a few sub-par games.
