Mechanical inventions are the most powerful tools humans have ever created. Why? Because they can utilize more energy faster than humans can.

The average human eats 2,000 calories per day. A gallon of gasoline is 28,746 calories.

The power of machines comes from converting useless materials (gasoline, coal, even wood, nuclear material) into mechanical energy.
