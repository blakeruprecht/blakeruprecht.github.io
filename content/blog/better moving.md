## 0. Tools/Env
You don't need much to move. Realistically, clothing and your choice of shoes are the only necessary things, but there are a few things that help you level up much faster.
- **Clothes** to stay warm when running outside, and to stay covered (legally) when exercising in public. You know enough about this, but try to not buy anything new, it won't bring you lasting happiness, I promise. What will is improving all aspects of your body through exercise. If you want proof, look into your own heart.
- **Shoes** to facillitate all exercise, I prefer as close to barefoot as possible so I can run, jump, lift, and do everything in one pair.
- **Pullup bar** is the most essential piece of calisthenics equipment, extremely helpful. Sometimes can be found around town/the woods.
- **Weights** for weightlifting, either barbells or dumbbells. Full access to a gym is great, but if you're purchasing, start with a barbell and plates.

Things I didn't mention include fancy running watches, smartphones to track progress, and any number of bull$hit products that promise to make you better at exercise but all they do is steal your money because no product can put love into your heart.

## 0.5 The Breath
Moving starts with how you breathe. What I mean by this is proper breathing forces proper posture. Proper breathing improves running and lifting posture. Proper breathing improves how you sit. It improves everything you do. It seems silly to "learn how to breathe", but odds are you're doing it wrong. First, breathe using only your nose as much as possible. This reduces heart rate and forces the body into "rest and digest" mode, enabling you to relax. Second, slow down the breath. Third, make sure your ab muscles are working to move your diaphragm. Sit with great posture. Imagine someone is pulling the back of your head as high as possible, making your spine straighten, shoulders fall back and down, and core activate to hold this position. While running, breathing should be as slow and regular as you can make it. Of course, once you go fast, you'll need to mouth breathe as well. With lifting, you should always breathe out during the concentric portion of the lift (the hard part), and breathe in during the eccentric portion of the lift.

## 1. Rules
Movement leads to physical adaptation within the body. We move for the joy of moving, but also for the improvement it brings to our bodies. Exercise can be conveniently divided based on the effect it has on our bodies: it either improves our cardiovascular system, improves our muscles, or both. Better cardiovascular strength enables our bodies to use oxygen and energy more efficiently, better muscles enables our bodies to perform movement better, stronger, and faster. There is no downside to improving either of these, besides the time taken to do it.

CARDIOVASCULAR ADAPTATIONS
- **Anaerobic**: maximum heart rate in 30 sec
	- TEST: get to max heart rate in 30 sec sprint, test recovery of 30 beats per min.
- **Aerobic**: 8-12 min bout of max effort
	- TEST: in lab, run for 12 min far as possible and look up VO2 conversion
- **Duration**: ability to move sub-maximally for a long time
	- TEST: >30 min consistent running?

MUSCLE ADAPTATIONS
- **Speed**: ability to move your body fast
	- TEST: Same as power
- **Power**: speed times force
	- TEST: standing broad jump at least > your height, or standing vertical jump at least > 24 inches
- **Strength**: force output
	- TEST: dynamometer > 40 kg each hand, or >60 sec bar hang. Goblet squat hold 1/2 your bodyweight for >45 secs is a good overall test of strength
- **Hypertrophy**: size of the muscles
	- TEST: DEXA scan, pay attention to FFMI > 20 for men
- **Skill**: the ability to move your body correctly
	- TEST: perform four exercise (upper push, upper pull, lower push, lower pull) and assess the symmetry, stability, and range of motion of the shoulder, elbow, low back, hip, knee, and ankle.
- **Muscular_Endurance**: ability of single muscle to perform multiple reps
	- TEST: max pushups >25, max pullups >10, max bodyweight squats >50

## 2. Level-up
As simply as possible, I'm going to do six workouts per week, three focused on cardio, three focused on muscles. Here's my schedule, you can move these around however you want. Try not to train muscles on back-to-back days, let them recover.
1. CARDIO_AEROBIC: Mcg3, 90-95% for 4x4:00 (4:00min rest), or 8-12min fast AF
2. LIFT_A: pullups/pushups, HINGE, Row/FacePull, IncCurl/DbCurl
3. CARDIO_ANAEROBIC: Mcg3, 100% for 10x30s (30s rest)
4. LIFT_B: pullups/pushups, SQUAT, Press/LatRaise, TriExt/TriDip
5. CARDIO_DURATION: Mcg3, run for 30+ mins, ideally 60-75
6. LIFT_C: pullups/pushups, CALVES/TIBS, NECK, GRIP, JUMPING

balance PUSH, PULL, SQUAT, HINGE

## 3. Tips
- CHOICES. There are a ton of choices to make when it comes to choosing exercise programs. Don't think too much. Do some cardio, do some muscles.
- AEROBIC TRAINING IS KING. Do a sprint workout, do a long-distance workout, but the more time you spend training aerobic capacity, the better off you are. It's the hardest, and VO2 max is king. Most lifting exercises will train your anaerobic capacity, so one sprinting exercise per week is sufficient to supplement. You can train more long-duration if you play soccer or want to run 10KM races, but I don't, so I won't.
- SIMPLE. Figuring out a lifting program is really tough, with so many options out there. Just remember that Pullups train the Shoulders, Traps, Lats, Biceps and Core. Pushups train the Shoulders, Chest, Triceps, and Core. And Split Squats train the Core, Glutes, Quads, Hamstrings, and Calves. Threee exercises can train the whole body, albeit not optimally. Plan everything you do around these three (a push, a pull, and a legs exercise)
- ATHLETICISM. If you want to improve for sports, focus on training your core, glutes, hamstrings, and quads. These are your dominant movers for athletic performance, which includes running, jumping, sprinting, and things like that. An RDL type movement is great for making you sprint faster (by training the hammies and glutes), a split squat is great for training your quads to help you jump, and a few more leg exercises can really improve your overall athleticism.
- PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD. Just make sure your increasing the number of reps or the weight your using with your lifting exercises. With bodyweight, you can find a more difficult variation to improve as well.
- ACCESSORIES. You can see that each lifting workout is designed to focus on Pullups, Pushups, and a key Leg exercise (Split Squats, Cleans, or RDLs). These are the only three that really matter. Otherwise, I throw in accessory work to hit the things I like doing, which include lots of arm exercises, Row/Press to balance out pullups and pushups, and some shoulder and calf work to beef up weak parts of my body. I also designed it to make Friday somewhat optional -- if I miss it, I'm not going to be screwed. May switch long-duration and anaerobic too, weekends can be tough to workout during lots of partying.
