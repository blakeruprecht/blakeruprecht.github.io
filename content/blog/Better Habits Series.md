We are what we repeatedly do. In this game of life, the actions we take everyday define who we are. It's hard to know what is worthwhile to do, and I think about this problem a lot. You can read for ages about these topics like me, but I wouldn't recommend it. Here, I list out the actions I do everyday and my thoughts about them. I've ordered them by importance, obviously love and community are the most important parts of life. As a caveat, if any of these actions fall under the "work" category for you, reference my "better creating" habit on how to get better at your chosen field. Mine is writing and research, but I think about getting better at any generic craft, the process tends to be the same no matter what field you are in.

Love and community are the most important parts of life, but by the nature of relationships being a two-way street, require action from other people as well.
