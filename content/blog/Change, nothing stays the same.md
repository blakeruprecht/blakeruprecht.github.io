It's a universal fact of life that time moves forward. Okay, moving on from there, physics tells us that everything in this universe is technically energy, which is subject to thermodynamic law, namely that entropy increases in this universe (in rare cases it can stay the same, mostly entropy just increases). Chaos will slowly take over every star and planet and tiny human on this miniscule Earth. Eventually, nothing will ever be beautiful again, once all energy homogenizes across the universe, which will turn one single color -- I'm not sure what color, but I know it will all be the same. And that's a shame. 

Fortunately, we have the opportunity to constantly work at reversing this process. Every second you give in, you inch closer to death (memento mori), but at least you can be calmed knowing that it doesn't really matter anyways (nihlism). Still, try to have fun, pursue your own values, and set goals to improve your world.(optimistic nihilism).

## Reference
- Robert Clausius, German scientist, physicist, discoverer of the concept of entropy as applied to thermodynamic systems
- The Stoic philsophers (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, other guy) who came up with Stoicism initially in the West. They were big on remembering and pondering their own mortalities, so that they were not regretful when it came time to die. Yes, live today like it could be your last, but that doesn't mean give in to temptation. [[_GOALS]] to the best of your abilities still.
- Taoism, the yin-yang inspires the concept of light and dark, creation and destruction. In fact, the yin-yang is such an influential concept that I do believe everything exists, *in some form*, on a binary scale. While that may very well be true, I'm not sure it provides enough clarity to deal with all of the complexities of life.
