Winning requires the abilities to win. To put it simply, it's anything that puts a W up on the scoreboard. It is difficult to determine what specific abilities lead to winning, so the best players act confident but drop their ego the second their abilities don't lead to the right outcome. Bad players blame others, but good players take Jocko Willink's advice(^1) and only blame themselves. They realize there is not "right way" to play a game, there is just winning and losing. The best players LOVE winning and HATE losing.

Practice. It seems so simple, yet the secret is to balance exploration of new techniques with exploitation of techniques that have worked in the past. There is no shortcut to finding the methods that work best for you besides exploring different techniques. There is no way to improve these techniques besides repetition. Sure, you can read about stuff, but that only helps point you in the right direction. You still have to do the thing to get better. The best players are relentless is seeking improvement, and this relentless shows itself in *quanitity of time spent practicing*. That's it, that's the secret the greats have. They weren't born great, they just do it a lot. They are constantly learning, exploring, and exploiting. 

Love. You must be fascinated in the game you are playing to get great at it. Otherwise, you will probably stink, or be average at best. Don't bother working on things that don't interest you, and sometimes, whatever interests you have, others may not recognize as interesting. Only play games that are a hell yes ([[Hell yes or no]]). And importantly, you can't just love playing, because that is undirected, you must LOVE WINNING, to direct yourself towards improvement.

Obviously, the quantity half of the class got way more practice at making pots, and ended up with way better pots. Quantity of practice trumps aiming for perfection on singular attempts, because you learn more by doing more attempts.
