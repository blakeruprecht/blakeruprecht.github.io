title: How to use Reinforcement Learning
description: '"Reinforcement learning is a paradigm for teaching machine learning models the right answers through trial and error, where they are only rewarded upon successful completion of a game, not at any previous step. It requires lots of computer, but finds fascinating solutions."'

NOTE: This post is still a W.I.P.

## RL is a learning *paradigm*
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm. By that I mean it's the way we tell the computer ML agent if it won or lost. Or if it's right or wrong. 

You know how agents are run on computers, right? The computers are calculating a bunch of equations. These equations determine the totality of what the agent perceives in the real world, as well as the decision-making process to choose actions.

The agent is trying to maximize reward. But first, it has to somehow get to the reward. It does this through random trial and error.

I got into AI a few years ago. I started learning about neural networks, then fuzzy logic, then evolutionary algorithms. My first real coding assignment was to code up a neural network by hand in python, and program it correctly to produce the right output values. My professor had us print off the outputs, and he graded them by hand. If you got it wrong, boom, -75%. Even if your code was mostly right. Brutal. I got a 25%. One line, in about 50 lines of code, was negative when it should have been positive.
