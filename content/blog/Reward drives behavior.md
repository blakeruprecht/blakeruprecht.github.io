If you want to win games, you should reward yourself only for winning. Not for "playing hard", or doing one skill really well, or for having more points than the other person. If you are losing and don't change your behavior, you will keep losing.

Animal behavior is the attempt to pass on the maximum amount of copies of their genes to the next generation. This is essential to [[Reinforcement Learning]]. Reproducing is the goal. Everything else is a result of this goal and a massive time-table. More advanced organisms thrive because they are better at competing for resources than simpler organisms. Sometimes. Simpler is still doing just fine (eg look at your tongue under a microscope you filthy bastard). Interspecies reproductive competition is sometimes as strong as conflict between species. Reward is access to choicest mating partner.

The thing that gives us "agency" is our ability to choose our own goals. As such, a tool AI is one that doesn't choose it's own goals, at least not really. Humans are agents because we can choose, though often, those that are not independent thinkers and just go along with the crowd end up acting more like tool Humans than they do intelligent Humans.
