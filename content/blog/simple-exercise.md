## Summary
Focus on proper technique for all movement, from breathing and standing, to running and lifting.
Build strength thru training pushing, pulling, and squatting movements.
Train Zone 2 cardio a lot each week.
Train Zone 4/5 cardio some each week.

## Physiological Adaptations of the Body to Exercise [1]
- Anaerobic endurance: max heart rate, how much work you can do at max effort 
- Aerobic endurance: bodies ability to efficiently use oxygen during exercise 
- Long-duration endurance: how long your body can perform sub-maximal work
- Technique: learning to move more effectively, efficiently, smoothly, and reducing risk of injury
- Muscular Endurance: how many reps in a row you can do 
- Strength: how effectively you can move something 
- Speed: moving at a higher velocity or with more accelaration 
- Power: speed multiplied by force 
- Size: how big the muscle is

## Training Pillars [2]
- Stability
  - Proper technique in all things, this is the most complicated topic here by far, it's basically "good form", which changes from exercise to exercise, and needs to be evaluated for each joint and each muscle individually.
  - Stability starts with nose-breathing
  - Stability includes proper posture, treat every movement you perform in life like an exercise, e.g. there is a proper form to sitting, to standing, to walking, to swimming, to swinging from trees, to chopping vegetables, to lifting things up off the ground, etc.
  - I can help you find more information on proper form, but don't feel like typing it out right now
- Strength: perform pushing, pulling, and squat hygiene each week [3]
  - [K Boges](https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges) calls this "hygiene", which I think is a great term. He's a super knowledgeable dude with the most minimalist strength training routine I have ever seen, and some great youtube videos going into depth
  - His routine is simple, as follows:
    - Pick one pushing exercise e.g. Pushup, Close-grip Pushup, Dip, etc.
    - Pick one pulling exercise e.g. Pullup, Chinup, Inverted Row, etc.
    - pick one leg exercise e.g. Bodyweight Squat, Lunge, etc.
    - perform 3 sets of close-to-max effort training for each movement, whenever you want, split up the different exercises throughout the day, try to keep all pushup sets together however, same for pulling and squats
- Perform plenty of Zone 2 training each week
  - Plenty is somewhere between two 30-min sessions and 180 mins of total work, work up to it
  - As fast as you can go while still nose-breathing
  - e.g. Run, Bicycle, Skip rope, Row, Swim, etc.
- Perform some Zone 4/5 training each week
  - One or two sessions a week is sufficient
    - e.g. 10 max effort sprints for 60 seconds with 2-4 minutes rest
    - e.g. interval run, 4 minutes close to all out, 4 minutes slow, for 4 cycles
  - This should be close to max effort or max effort

Though there are three physical adaptations to cardio, aerobic and long-duration training can be trained at the same time by doing large volumes of Zone 2 (as fast as you can go while still nose-breathing) training in some modality like running, skipping rope, swimming, biking, etc.
