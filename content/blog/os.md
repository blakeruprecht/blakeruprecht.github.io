I recently posted about my [Linux setup](simple-software.md), and I've come to a shocking realization -- any OS is fine. Strengths and drawbacks, right?

- Linux:
	- Cost: FREE
	- Ease of use: ADVANCED USERS, MOSTLY
	- Coding: OTIMAL
- MacOS: 
	- Cost: EXPENSIVE (requires an expensive macbook)
	- Ease of use: EASY TO USE
	- Coding: EASY
- Windows:
	- Cost: EXPENSIVE (requires a $100 license)
	- Ease of use: FINE
	- Coding: ANNOYING

If you already have Windows, my recommendation is to just keep it until you get annoyed enough to need to switch, which could be never. If you already have MacOS, just keep it, it's totally okay. If you have nothing already and want to spend zero money, install [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.org).
