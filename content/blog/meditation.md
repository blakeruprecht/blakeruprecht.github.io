title: Meditation teaches the Way
description: '"Meditation is the foundational practice to living a good life. It teaches you how to do nothing so that you can do anything well."'

Meditation is the art of inaction. It's the practice of doing nothing. While there are numerous benefits of meditation for overall health and well-being, and often neglected benefit of meditation is how it helps you do everything else. Since you learn to quiet your thoughts about the past and future and focus totally on the present, meditation develops the quality of mind that is necessary for success in almost every other endeavor -- attention.

Sitting meditation, or zen, is the foundation of meditative practices, but there are many others ways to meditate. In fact, doing anything with full attention counts as meditation. This includes daily practices like exercise, nutrition, and recovery. While seemingly done to improve bodily health, these are all opportunities to improve mental health as well. Exercise can be seen as some grueling task that forces you to concentrate, or also seen as a meditative practice where you try to lose yourself in the motions. If you dedicate 15 minutes to exercise, attempt to keep that 15 minutes as focused on your muscles and breathing as possible, not on the past or future.

So yes, meditation is the art of inaction, but the point of learning how to do nothing is so that you can learn how to do everything.

Practice your breathing. Practice how you brush your teeth. Practice how you sweep the floors, wash your hands, cook pasta, lift weights, run around, talk to others, share stories. Practice everything.
