title: Speed is the inverse of time
description: '"Speed is the inverse of time, and time is the one resource we will all eventually run out of, hence speed is power."'

## Physics Primer
Work is equal to force times distance. Squatting your own weight plus 100 kilograms accomplishes the same amount of work regardless of how fast you do it. If you go really slow, let's say it takes you 100 seconds, and you travel a vertical distance of 1 meter down and 1 meter back up. Technically this accomplishes zero work, but we'll take the absolute value for fun.
- W = |fd|
- f = ma (more precisely, f = (d/dt)(mv))
- W = |mad|
- W = |(100 kgs)(10 m/s^2)(2 m)| = 2000 Joules = 478 cal = 0.48 kCal

A human body doing this work on a barbell exerts 2000 Joules of energy using the arms, torso, and legs. This is the equivalent of using 0.48 kilocalories or "Calories" as confusingly displayed on nutrition labels. If this indeed takes 100 seconds, your average Power output would have been:
- P = f/t
- P = (2000 J)/(100 s) = 20 Watts

This is the rate at which work is done or energy transferred. Saying 20 Watts is equivalent to saying 20 Joules per second. If the squat only takes 10 seconds, then the power output would be 200 Watts (J/s). Increasing the speed at which you do something directly increases the power with which you do that thing. As you can see, energy and work are scalar values, they have nothing to do with time, whereas power has everything to do with time. It's a rate. In this scenario, it describes how quickly you get a specified amount of work done. The more powerful you are, the faster you can get the work done.

## Sports
It's pretty obvious that speed benefits sports. Just look at Tyreek Hill.
