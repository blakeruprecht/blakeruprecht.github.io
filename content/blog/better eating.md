## Summary
- Food builds our bodies, so it's pretty important
- Eat plenty of proteins, fats, and carbs
- Eat lots of micronutrients thru veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, dairy, meat
- Drink as much water as you're thirsty for
- In general, follow the Mediterranean diet as a simple guideline to eat well
- Eat natural, unprocessed foods
## Why is this important?
Your body is made up of organic matter, which you get from food. So basically, you literally are what you eat. So if you eat junk, your body will be made of junk. Of course, the body does a wonderful job breaking down junk into useable parts, but it's still way better to eat clean, natural foods.
## What should I eat?
There is a lot of bogus stupid information on the internet being spouted out by people trying to sell you shit. Don't listen to those fools. Instead of thinking about diets, I like to simplify my food into three categories: water, macronutrients, micronutrients.
## How much water?
The general recommendation is drink when you are thirsty. I'm not kidding. On hot days, you have to drink more. Duh. Basically, get a water bottle (I have a HydroFlask 24oz, and as much as I don't recommend buying stuff, especially expensive stuff, a water bottle is a relatively inexpensive upgrade to greatly improve one of the most important habits of your life, so don't worry about price if you can afford it.) A glass works too. If your pee is consistently yellow or brown, please drink more water.
## How many macronutrients?
There are four macronutrients: protein, fats, carbohydrates, and alcohols. You don't need alcohol to survive, but do realize that it's a macronutrient that gets burned as energy faster than carbohydrates (this is why when you drink beer, the alcohol gets burned as energy, and the carbs in the beer get stored as fat). Every human needs to eat plenty of protein and fats. Carbs are basically the simple energy source of the body, and are also necessary. My general recommendation is to eat the same amount that I burn. Calories in, calories out, you can't beat fundamental thermodynamics. If you eat more than you burn, you gain weight, if you eat less, you lose weight. If you're exercising a lot (which you should), you'll need a lot of protein. The general rule of thumb is 0.7-1.0 g per pound of lean bodyweight.
## How many micronutrients?
Yeah, this one is tough, because you don't know what you're eating unless you track each foods full nutritional breakdown, or by getting frequent bloodtests. To simplify this, just eat a wide range of vegetables and fruits, some nuts and seeds, and whole grains. Meat and dairy sources help a lot with micronutrients as well. If you're going to cut out a major foodgroup, you need to know what micronutrients you're likely to become deficient in.
## What about processed foods?
No, don't eat them, try as hard as you possibly can to avoid foods coming from plastic bags. This isn't an environmental point, this is about health. Processed foods are cheaper, and I understand not being able to afford good food. Do the best you can.
## Okay seriously, what do I eat?
The toughest part about eating right is getting enough micronutrients. If you don't eat meat, you may not get enough Iron. If you don't eat vegetables, you may not get enough Calcium or Vitamin C. The best recommendations I have seen for diet include Mediterranean and Vegetarian diets. I suspect this is because both diets are heavy in fruits and vegetables and all the other good stuff that obviously helps the body, like nuts, seeds, whole grains, and healthy fats. For me, I have no health conditions, allergies, or pickiness that prevents me from eating any specific food, so I choose the Mediterranean diet to base my food selections off of. YMMV.

Check out this handy photo. It basically shows the emphasis on WHOLE grains, with tons of fruits, veggies, beans, nuts, seeds, legumes, and olive oil. Of course, cheese and yogurt are great additions, as well as fish, poultry, and eggs. "Meat", meaning red meat like beef and pork, is pretty limited. If you choose to eat vegetarian or vegan, those diets line up very closely with this one, the top parts are just replaced with substitutes and multi-vitamins.

Basically, eat your damn veggies, that's the advice every dietician is trying to tell you. Avoid processed foods, they're bad for you. Any specific diet, meal timing, intermittent fasting, all that stuff isn't necessary. The whole point is finding routines that stick, so if that means intermittent fasting for you, great, but that doesn't change the laws of thermodynamics (cals in = cals out).
