Life is a mystery. We are currently incapable of solving it, from our limited perspective. Every philosophy on Earth has tried and failed. The question is too big, perhaps beyond the scope of what humans can ever achieve in our collective lifetimes. Hell, the sun may burn out before we come up with a definitive answer. AI could solve it in 20 years. All I know, is that our current intelligence level has yet to come up with an answer. This doesn't mean don't try, but it means don't waste time trying to work on the single hardest question humans have ever posed. Don't blindly fall into faith either, since all of those stories have been made up by past, long-dead humans, with no solid evidence supporting them in any way.
