- Some examples of addictive behaviors? "When I use the word drug, I'm talking about substances and behaviors really. And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex, gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work." [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction @ 00:32:24](https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8?t=1944)
- Social media as an addictive behavior? "So the first message I would want to get across about social media is that it really is a drug and it's engineered to be a drug." [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction @ 01:41:40](https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8?t=6100)
- Why porn can cause issues? "But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release will make it harder to achieve the same level and certainly the greater level of dopamine through a subsequent interaction. So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography and yes, indeed, many people who regularly indulge in pornography experience challenges in real world romantic interactions."

- Why is controlling dopaminergenic activities (especially low-effort, addictive behaviors that cause releases of dopamine) important? Because it reduces our dopamine baseline and makes getting pleasure out of everyday activities more difficult.
