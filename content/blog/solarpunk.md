description: '"Solarpunk is a relatively new movement promoting ecologically beneficial solutions. It is related to deep ecology, anarchism, and other belief systems."'

Basically Deep ecology, Anarcho communism, but seemingly more hopeful.

## Solarpunk
- Current knowledge of human happiness
- Deep ecology, sustainability taken farther
- Engineering
	- green energy, composite wood buildings, green architecture, water?
- Permaculture
- Bicycling, Public transportation
- Walkable cities
## Peace
- The "Hierarchy" of Needs is really a *circle*
- Peace and Love, I'm a dirty hippie
- Clocks are a capitalist invention to keep the common man down
	- The rhythms of the natural world are forgotten
	- We are not robots, we are large mammals who want to finish up work by noon to go surf and dance
- Wage-slavery. If you don't control your own life, you are a slave to others. How to break free? Is it literally that bad? There are no whips or chains, making you think you are free, there is just the comfort of everyday. If this hurts to hear, that's because you know it's true deep down.
- Abolish borders, there is no such thing as a "state", we and the Iranian people are more alike than I am to my goverment and capitalist overlords
- Permaculture
	- Get involved with environmentalists, that is the path towards justice and peace
- Si vis pacem, para bellum
	- John Brown gun club
	- Redneck revolution
- Science writing
	- How can I write about this from a scientific, systems thinking, economics, deep ecology perspective, while remembering that humans are *mostly* emotional, and I'm actually the odd-ball
	- "Empathy is what radicalized me, theory came after."
- Advertising is not your friend
	- Banksy quote
	- Fuck greenwashing
- Ancient teachers
	- Diogenes, Epicurus, MLK, Gandhi, Tolstoy, Kropotkin, etc.
- Praxis
	- 1. Get your house in order
		- Live like a hippie, ride bikes, grow gardens, minimize possessions, anti-consumerism, don't buy shit
		- Move into the country taking the lowest paying job you can get away with
- Modern corporations are just serfdoms with Kings and Lords replaced by Owners and C-level execs, instead of wearing crowns, they wear neckties
	- Go from Corporations to Co-ops, you go from serf to citizen, from a wage-slave to a democratic voter
- Anarchism
- Untrackable stuff
	- Cash is *untrackable*
	- Letters are *untrackable*
- Library economy
	- competition --> cooperation
- "IF you have a garden, and a library, you have everything you need."
