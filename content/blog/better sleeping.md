## **Summary**
- Sleep is essential to our overall well-being
- The typical person needs 7-9 hours a night, I think I need either 7 or 9
- Sleeping env should be cool (<68 degF), lots of blankets very dark, and have good air quality
- To regulate wakeup and sleep times, focus on regulating your circadian rhythym properly by viewing early morning sunlight as soon as you wakeup, viewing evening sunlight, and limiting light to dim red light and firelight at night to prevent artificial wakefulness.
- I'm not sure if tracking is beneficial yet.

## **Why is sleep important?**
Sleep is foundational to our success as humans. It enables muscular growth and recovery, learning, skill-building, and more. Suffice to say, it's extremely important, and the single largest activity we will do as humans over the course of our lifetimes, taking up roughly 1/3 of our entire lives. As much as you may love or hate sleep, it makes sense to try to master the craft of sleeping in order to improve your overall life.

## **What should my sleeping environment look like?**
A few basics. The temperature should be cool enough that you can have multiple blankets that you can use to add and remove layers throughout the night. If it's too hot, you can't remove any more layers, and if it's too cold and you don't have enough blankets, you'll shiver and get bad sleep. Otherwise, air quality should be good in the room (well-ventilated), and plants are a big plus for improving air quality indoors. Additionally, it should be very dark in the room (doesn't have to be pitch black).

## **How much time is enough?**
The typical recommendations are 7-9 hours per night, but this number varies based on genetics. Some people only need 6, some need 10, especially teenagers and athletes need more.

## **How do I regulate the timing?**
You may be envious of people who wakeup at consistent times. A lot of this comes down to your circadian rhythym, which is influenced by sunlight. So, the best thing to do to regulate your sleep is to get sunlight into your eyes immediately upon waking to set your circadian clock. Get sunlight in your eyes for 10-30 minutes (don't stare directly at it obviously). This will help you wakeup at a consistent time. Furthermore, the more sunlight you get throughout the day, especially in the evening, the better off you'll be. It will be easier to go to bed at the right time. Additionally, it's extremely beneficial to limit any other light sources at night time, e.g. overhead lights and bright LED light bulbs. Instead, if you need to have lights on, make sure they are very dim, prefereably red light, and fire is even better.

## **Should I track anything?**
Maybe. It may be beneficial to track waking time, and potentially subjective "restedness", but I haven't looked into this yet, so who cares for now.
