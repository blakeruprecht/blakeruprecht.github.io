- Train every muscle 5 sets per week to maintain performance
  - Generally, group the muscles into four categories:
    - Pushers: upper/middle/lower chest, front deltoid, triceps
    - Pullers: upper/middle/lower traps, lattisimus dorsi, rear deltoid, biceps
    - Hinge: back core, glutes, hamstrings, front calfs
    - Squat: front core, side core, glutes, quads, back calfs

- Remember, performance is based on:
  - Technique/Skill: how well the joints moves through space
  - Strength: how much mass you can lift
  - Speed: how fast you can contract your muscles
  - Power: strength times speed
  - Endurance: how many reps of a given exercise you can do
  - Hypertrophy: the size of the muscle
