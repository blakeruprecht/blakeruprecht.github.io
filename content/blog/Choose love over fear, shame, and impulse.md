This is heavily based around the concept of chakras, and I think it's a good metaphor to describe some of the powerful emotions that hold us, as humans, back from fully opening our hearts and loving others.

## Choose courage over fear
WHAT IS FEAR?
Fear is the ultimate form of pain in life. It was developed long ago as our primary survival instinct, and leads to isolation and sadness in life. We must conquer our fears in order to fully embrace life. To unblock:
- Recognize and confront feelings of fear head-on
- When you do, take slow breaths to calm yourself down
- Then, decide to act or remain still. Some fear makes sense to run away from, like snakes or tornados. Other fear actually points us to what we want in life, like fear of publishing writings, or fear of talking to our crushes. If you're not afraid to do something hard, you probably just don't care about it.
- This way, fear becomes your servant, rather than your master. You can choose to respond to it, rather than letting it respond for you.

RESULT: Courage
- You are no longer controlled by your fear. You are now open and vulnerable, no longer isolated, ready to embrace life and relationships. You can pursue the things you want in life because you aren't afraid of failure, perfectionism, or rejection anymore.

## Choose acceptance over shame
WHAT IS SHAME?
All humans feel ashamed of being animals, and yet feel sorrow that they have missed out on fun experiences because of their shame. Nevertheless, energy must flow through our bodies, and if you hold it back from the places it wants to go, it will lead to obstructions like addictions, regret, etc. To unblock:
- Recognize and confront feelings of shame head-on
- Accept that you cannot get rid of these feelings of desire and shame. You are a flawed, imperfect animal.
- Choose to act on desires in a healthy way, or channel them productively
	- Don't try to solve the problem yourself, in isolation, e.g. masturbation, internet surfing, drugs (these all lead to addiction)
	- Healthy ways involve relationships with other people and nature
	- Channel your desires into physical activity and creative endeavors.

RESULT: Acceptance
- You are no longer controlled by your shame and addictions, you accept yourself and are capable of channeling your energy into relationship and creative endeavors. You are now ready to be productive and serve others.

## Choose discipline over impulse
WHAT IS IMPULSE?
We all have basic impulses, ranging from fear and shame, to hedonistic desires. These often harm our lives, and lead us to unhappiness. So many people struggle with them, and the only solution is discipline. The trick is, you can't be disciplined if you are afraid or lacking energy from relationships. To unblock:
- Decide what your goals in life are, write them down as specifically as possible. If you have no specific intention, you will go nowhere.
- Do positive actions everyday to move towards your goals.
- Do what you can, with what you have, where you are

RESULT: Discipline
- You are no longer controlled by your momentary impulse, you accept the challenges of the road ahead and confront them head-on, following the path that you choose for yourself. The trick isn't ignoring your basic self, but channeling it all productively into the direction you want to go in.

## Summary
Teach your mind to override fear *when you want to* and it serves your goals in life. Fear is okay to feel, and sometimes it leads you to where you should really go.

Teach your mind to recognize desire, and instead of filling the voids in your life with masturbation/weed/drinking/internet, channel that energy into relationships and creative endeavors.

Teach your mind to overcome impulse by doing positive actions everyday to progress down the path towards your goals.
