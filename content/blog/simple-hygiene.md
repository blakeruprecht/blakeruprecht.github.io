## A note on taking a random person's medical advice: don't
So much related to general health and hygiene should come from your personal doctors who gives you checkups, so I don't have much more advice to give, besides listen to the professionals. Sure, some of them are in the pockets of big-pharma, but for the most part, they have good advice. Get a second opinion if you want, but this is *not* really the area to "do your own research", since the field of medicine is legitimately insanely complex and difficult to understand. It's not like fixing your own car, which can be done by reading the manual. Of course, that could kill you too if you mess up, so be cautious there.

I guess I'm mainly writing this because I've never seen a comprehensive list like this, and am curious about how other people view this topic. The point is, nothing in life is "obvious" to people who don't know, that's why learning is a thing.

## Hygiene practices

Daily Hygiene
- brush teeth 2x per day, floss 1x per day [1]
- protect eyes with sunglasses (multiple optometrists have told me this is the single most important thing you can do for lifelong eye health [2]
- wear sunscreen (especially on your face) and moisturize (not sure why) [3]
- shower daily-ish (the less you shower, the more water you conserve for nature)
  - bonus for using cold water, it releases dopamine and feels great... afterwards haha
- pee/poo as needed, but make sure you enjoy life's simple pleasures :)
- wash your hands before you handle food, or before sticking your hand in your mouth/eyes/etc
  - similar to wearing a mask, this may not always be necessary for your own health, but it helps prevent the spread of disease, potentially saving the lives of elderly and infant humans
- clean surfaces in your kitchen, especially countertops, and clean dishes

Weekly Hygiene
- wash hair somewhere between every other day and every month
  - don't know exactly what to do here, but I've heard that sulfates/sulfites are terrible for hair, so I would air on the side of natural soaps / Dr. Bronner's
- clean all textiles (clothes/sheets/towels) that touch your body weekly, same soap recommendations, go for natural / Dr. Bronner's
- clean environment around you weekly - dust surfaces, sweep/vaccuum floors, clean sinks, toilets, shower, other appliances

\>Monthly Hygiene
- visit the dentist every 6 months [1]
- get an eye exam once per year [2]
- get a skin exam once per year [3]
- get a general physician exam once per year
