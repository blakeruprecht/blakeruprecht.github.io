## Summary
Let's get something out of the way -- there is no magic diet, pill you can take, or one-stop solution to nutrition -- at least not yet. If you expect to find an easy solution, find someone trying to sell you something. The hard truth is that human nutrition is complicated, there are a lot of essential nutrients we need, and there aren't many shortcuts to eating natural, whole food.

## It's a personal problem
What should I eat? This is a question I ask myself everyday. You'd think being a 20-something I would have figured this simple life question out by now, but I'm not even close. Of no fault but my own, I've forgotten to eat for long enough stretches that I've involuntarily fasted and passed out. Apparently there are benefits to fasting, but I'm pretty sure it has to be intentional. I've been a dedicated exerciser (what a weird thing to be, the default of human experience is exercise) for a decade and have managed to see almost zero progress due to my stubborn refusal to fuel my body properly. I've done a bit of an experiment to see if you can become a bodybuilder by eating a caloric deficit and small amounts of protein. The answer is hell no, obviously, why would you even think that?

I ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every single day for the first 18 years of my life, thanks Mom. I ate a fruit smoothie (almost) every single day for the next seven years of my life. Now, I consider myself an amateur *chef* or whatever the politically correct term is for someone who hates listening to directions. I love to cook, but still struggle with what I should eat, every damn day. So here are the spark notes to human nutrition, compiled by someone who doesn't really care about the facts, mostly just wants to eat yummy food, and desires to achieve proper nutrition levels to eventually make progress on push-ups, but that last one is a wistful goal.

## Water
**Drink when thirsty**. Haha, tricked you, you thought I was gonna talk about food. Well, really, water is an essential nutrient too. Our bodies already have a ton of water in them, but we lose water everyday through breathing, sweating, urinating, and defecating. So, we have to replenish it. How much each day? The current recommendation is "drink when you're thirsty", which attempts to recognize that every individual loses a different amount of water each day, so needs to drink a different amount, and this also changes with air temperature and activity levels. So drink when thirsty.

**What about non-water drinks?** They're all basically water with more steps, so why overcomplicate it? I'm kidding, matcha is delicious, I've been a cold-brew coffee addict for years, beer is practically a deity in my life, and I love a glass (or bottle) of cabernet or pinot grigio. Just try to avoid sugary drinks, since sugar is E.V.I.L.

## Protein
**Why bother with nerd food?** Do you like breathing? Do you like walking? How about moving around, doing things, having fun? It all takes muscle. That thing beating in your chest, pumping blood and energy and oxygen throughout the body? A big ol' muscle. Even if you don't hit the gym, you use muscles everyday. They're a non-negotiable. Without muscle, your bones collapse and hit the floor in a sack of skin with a puddle of organs at the bottom. Nobody wants that. There's no substitute for protein, it's essential to building muscle and many other components of the body. Muscle is crucial for overall health, not just for iron pumpers, and the only way to get some is by eating all 10 essential amino acids. What's an amino acid you might ask? Me too, shame this isn't a dialogue. All we need to know as passionate non-chefs is there are 10 of them. Great number, by the way, good on you human body. The trick here is that some foods have more of these aminos and some have less. For example, rice has all of them, but has miniscule amounts of a few of them, so if you try to get all of your protein from rice, you can do it, but you won't get enough of some of these magical amino acids. We can go on and on about this detail, but most every single world culture has solved this problem by pairing rice with *beans*, the magical fruit that is good for your heart. Rice and beans baby, we can build empires off of these because they got *hella* amino acids, more than you need, if you eat excessive amounts that is.

**How much should you eat?** Yeah, don't really know. Generally lifting recommendations are 0.7-1.2g per pound of bodyweight (convert this yourself if you're a healthcare enjoyer), and I'm generally inclined to hit 0.7-0.71 as a satisficer. More generally seems like overkill unless you're a seriously dedicated bodybuilder, which again, I refuse to be. If you are, hit that 1.0g sweet spot because it's a round number, why else? If you don't exercise at all, you probably don't care about nutrition either, so eat whatever the hell you want, you don't care.

**What about MEAT**. It's freaking delicious. I love smoked pulled pork, smoked chicken, brisket, Italian beef, grilled chicken, grilled fish, fried chicken, fried fish,... Most all of it. Poultry, mammal, even insect (shoutout to the cricket farmers, I love your work), are all great sources of the 10 amino acids, plus they include a lot of vitamins and minerals, which we will include next. There is a great reason why meat has always been a delicacy and highly valued food source -- it's amazing. Sure, nowadays we've realized that red meat (beef, pork, your mom) are high in saturated fats, so must be eaten in moderation, but who cares. Unless you're vegetarian or vegan, which have some damn good sustainability reasons behind them, but those have nothing to do with nutrition. A lot of people report feeling healthier on those diets, but I suspect that has more to do with eating tons of fruits, veggies, and legumes, rather than the fact that meat is cut out. To each their own.

## Fats
**Won't those make me fat?** An excess of calories makes you fat, dummy, if I hear about low-fat anything I'm going to flip my lid. This is my personal pet peeve, a marketing ploy by Big Corn to get idiots to eat less of the good stuff (fatty acids), and more of the evil stuff (fuck you sugar). The body can't actually produce fatty acids, so if you don't eat them, you will die a slow, painful death.

**What should I eat?** Okay, there is an evil fat -- trans fat. Produced through hydrogenation, this is totally unecessary and clogs up the bodies pipes, and not the ones that make you fart. It'll kill you dead, so avoid avoid avoid. The GOAT fat to eat is *olive oil* because it's delicious and made from the olive. Olive oil has a lot of unsaturated fat and some saturated fat, which fulfills most of your fatty acid needs. It's recommended to supplement this with some animal fat, yogurt, cheese, coconut, etc. to get a bit more saturated fat (which your body needs, just not too much, like is found in mcdonalds sludge).

**And the omegas?** Omega-3 and omega-6 are the two types of unsaturated fat. Marine products like fish are high in omega-3, vegetable oils are high in omega-6, you need both.

## Carbohydrates are totally unnecessary
**But I would perish without them**. Bread is my favorite food in the. A sexy whole-wheat loaf of sourdough bread is what the center of the earth is made out of. If you dig down far enough, you can eat it. While carbohydrates are technically not necessary since the human body can turn proteins and fats into glucose, it's much easier to just eat some carbs and save your body the effort.

**Yes to sugar, or no to sugar?** Yes and no. Whole carbs like brown rice and whole-wheat are great for you since they include complex sugars, whereas white rice only has simple sugars. Simple sugars aren't technically evil, but it's easy to go overboard on them. Lots of food have added sugar, which is typically processed sugar. This is evil according to Wikipedia, but it refuses to tell me the secrets, so for now, avoid candy but eat white rice.

**And what about starch and glycogen?** Great question, those are polysaccharides, a huge term which means "complex AF". These are the magical complex carbs we talked about earlier, so definitely eat them. Cooking helps break them down.

## Are we done yet?
**No. You gotta take your vitamins**. And "minerals", which is an outdated term for 15 (and maybe up to 25) other chemical elements which the human body can't produce and aren't found in every food.

**What "minerals" to eat?** These extra chemical elements are important because the body is made of chemical elements and does a whole bunch of microscopic wizadry to turn these elements into things like bones, eyeballs, and toe gunk. You need them. Some of them are electrolytes, which help transfer electricity in the body, and some are "cofactors" which help amino acids create enzymes. Who knows why, it's the body, we don't need to question it.
- Macro (humans need > 150 mg/day): Calcium, Chlorine, Magnesium, Phosphorous, Potassium, Sodium
- Micro (humans need < 150 mg/day): Cobalt, Copper, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Selenium, Zinc
- Maybe (we probably need a tiny bit and haven't done any studies to disprove it yet, I'm *not* volunteering): Bromine, Arsenic, Nickel, Flourine, Boron, Lithium, Strontium, Silicon, Vanadium 

**Back to the vitamins**. There are 13, you need them all, yadda yadda, no I don't know what they do, just like the minerals they do good stuff for you, if you skip out on one you'll probably die, just eat a variety of foods, take a multivitamin, or get a blood test to figure it out.
- Team-2-B: Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12
- Team-Not-2-B: A, C, D, E, K (technically the body can create vitamin D from UVB radiation from sunlight exposure)

**What about antioxidants?** Marketing bullshit, they have poor bioavailability and all get pee/pooed out.

**Gut flora / microbiome**. Yes, important, there are millions of bacteria, archaea, and fungi that live in your stomach and help you digest food. So cool. You probably don't need to buy "special" foods, just follow the Mediterranean diet, which brings us to...

## Follow the Mediterranean Diet
That's the ultimate recommendation for eating, keep it simple and follow this easy peasy guideline. Actually, it's not simple at all, it tells you to eat a huge variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole-grains, and limited dairy and meat. This isn't easy, but there's no crying in cooking! Building a body full of muscles, bones, organs, brain, nerves, and millions of specialized little cells isn't easy either, so cut your body some slack. Avoid processed food at all costs. Really a lot of what will harm you is the stuff coming in packages and out of drive-thrus. There's a lot of argument going around about the relative amounts of different ingredients, from carbs to fats to proteins, but everyone agrees that amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals are essential. Hence, the Mediterranean diet focuses on the heavy hitters, veggies.

The other essential guideline is to eat *natural* foods, which is basically just reiterating the advice to avoid processed, packaged, and drive-thru foods. Sure, go for organic local farmers markets, but there's no definitive evidence that GMOs are harmful from a nutrition standpoint. The ecological problems are a whole other concern.

Here's my secret little trick to eat Mediterranean: SALSA. Yes, the Spanish word for "sauce". Sauce is the secret ingredient, because Sauce is the tricky method many delicious cuisines use to sneak more vegetables into meals. You love chips and salsa, right? (If you don't, GTFO). It's delicious, and salsa is secretly just all healthy food.

SALSA = Tomatos + Chilis + Onions + Garlic + Lime + Cilantro

See that? Four guaranteed veggies, one fruit, and one mystery (tomatoes what are you?) Boom, that's already a serving of goodness that goes straight to your thighs.

Don't believe me? Check out the following recipes:
- Tikka Masala
	- **Tomatoes, Chilis, Onions, Garlic, Lime, Cilantro**, Ginger
	- Chicken, Yogurt, Heavy cream, Olive Oil
	- Salt, Black pepper, Chili powder, Turmeric, Garam masala, Sugar
- TexMex Burrito Bowl
	- **Tomatoes, Chilis, Onions, Garlic, Lime, Cilantro**
	- Chicken, Brown rice, Black beans, Yogurt, Cheese, Avocado, Bell pepper, Corn
	- Salt, Black pepper, Chipotle peppers, Cumin, Oregano
- Mediterranean Pita Kebab
	- **Tomatoes, Chilis, Onions, Garlic, Lemon, Cilantro**
	- Chicken, Brown rice, Hummus, Dill, Cucumber
- Spaghetti
	- **Tomatoes, Chilis, Onions, Garlic, Lemon, Basil**
	- Carrots, Ground beef, Ground pork, Red wine, Olive oil, Sugar
	- Salt, Black pepper, Oregano

The first line in every recipe is SALSA? What are the odds??? Sure, some use lemon instead of lime, which makes hardly any difference since both are delicious, and maybe some herb substitutions, but same idea. All they change are the relative *ratios*, between ingredients. And bell peppers are just chili peppers with the fun parts removed for no good reason, a travesty!

As you can clearly see, salsa is a revolutionary new approach to cooking, adopted by most international cuisines shortly after people realized tomatoes won't actually kill you just because they're red, and they're easy to grow too. The Americas also contributed the chili pepper, which is a godsend to flavor. So thanks to my neighbors down south, *Viva Mexico!*

## Biochemistry Summary
- Food is necessary for energy, and also the proper functioning of different chemical processes in the body.
- There are seven major nutrients, which can be split up into macro- and micro-
  - Macronutrients
    - Water (no energy): essential to replace water lost through urine/feces/sweat/breathing, the modern recommendation is drink when you are thirsty since the amount needed varies based on age, activity level, local weather, etc.
    - Protein (17 kJ/g or 4 kcal/g): essential to build many structures in the body like muscles, skin, hair, there are 10 essential amino acids found in complete proteins (e.g. chicken) or can be found by combining two incomplete proteins (e.g. rice and beans) which works just as well, provided you eat *enough* protein, e.g. for athletic people, 0.7g/lb of bodyweight per day.
    - Fats (37 kJ/g or 9 kcal/g): essential to build cells and signalling molecules, eliminate all trans fats, eat both saturated (e.g. animal fats, coconut oil) and unsaturated (e.g. plant/fish fats) fats 
    - Carbohydrates (17 kJ/g or 4 kcal/g): technically not essential to eat, but they are a great energy source, mono- and di- saccharides are worse than polysaccharides (complex carbs), though all provide energy. Mono- di- are bad for your teeth since they stick to them and allow plaque to build up, whereas poly- don't. Recommendation, eat whole-grains, eliminate simple sugars and processed sugars. So no sweets/white bread, or limit as much as possible.
    - Fiber (no energy): necessary, helps with digestion, found in whole-grains and many vegetables so stick to Med. diet and you'll be fine
  - Micronutrients
    - "Minerals": really chemical elements, 15-25 are essential for many different processes in the body, best recommendation is to eat Mediterranean diet and get blood tests for deficiencies/excessed
    - Vitamins: there are 13 essential ones, found in many different foods, also serving many varied purposes in the body, best recommendation is to follow Med. & get blood tests.

## Biochemistry of the Macronutrients
- Carbohydrates: made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, e.g. glucose is C^(6)H^(12)O^(6)
  - Technically not necessary for humans to eat since proteins and fats can be converted into glucose for energy through a process called ketosis (similar to what sled dogs do)
  - There are mono-, di-, and poly- saccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain (1, 2, 3 or more)
  - Examples:
    - Mono: glucose, fructose, lactose
    - Di: sucrose, lactose, maltose
    - Poly: starch, glycogen (these are the "complex" carbs)
      - Cooking starch makes it more easily digestible
- Fats: made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen
  - Dietary fat consists of several fatty acids bonded to a glycerol
    - e.g. triglycerides are three fatty acides bonded to one glycerol
  - Saturated fats have all carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms
    - Likely to be solid at room temperature
  - Unsaturated fats have some carbon atoms double bonded, so less total hydrogen per unit length
    - Either have one double bond (monounsaturated) or many (polyunsaturated)
    - Depending on location of double bond, classified as either Omega-3 or Omega-6
      - These are the two *essential* fatty acids since the body cannot produce them
      - Marine food sources are high in Omega-3 (e.g. fish)
      - Veggie oils have both O-3 and O-6, but much higher in O-6
    - Trans Fats have trans-isomer bonds, rare in nature, typically created through an industrial process called hydrogenation. These are universally regarded as bad for humans by everyone except companies who sell them.
- Fiber: a special type of polysaccharide that is incompletely absorbed by humans
  - Insoluble fiber (e.g. cellulose) is indigestible, e.g. resistant starch can be fermented by microbes in the stomach to produce short-chain fatty acids, utilized by colon cells for food
  - Soluble fiber (e.g. waxes, esters, oligosaccharides) dissolve/gelatinize in water, can also be fermented
  - Fiber adds bulk to the intestinal content of food
  - Fiber helps peristalsis, the muscular contraction of the intestines which moves food along the digestive track (cool to remember the intestines are muscles too)
  - Some fiber creates a more viscous solution, slowing the transport of food through the intestines (this seems in opposition to the last point)
- Proteins (really, amino acids): made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen 
  - Form the basis of many structures of the body, e.g. muscle, skin, hair, and form the enzymes which control chemical reactions in the body
  - Absorbed into the blood in the small intestine, cannot be stored, so are either burnt for energy (metabolized) or sent off into the urine to be *removed*
  - Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions
  - Some amino acids are essential, can't be produced in the body
    - Human body requires 10 or so, a *complete* protein has all 10 e.g. chicken
      - It is possible to combine two incomplete proteins to form all 10, e.g. rice and beans. This forms the foundation of many cuisines
      - A well planned vegan diet can easily get enough protein, as long as all 10 amino acids are eaten roughly every day, e.g. to build muscle eat 0.7g per pound of bodyweight
- Water: you know what it is, *dun duh nuh nahhhhh*
  - We already got water in the body, but we lose it through urine, defecation, sweating, and exhaling breath, so we have to replace it
  - The amount you need to drink depends on how much you pee, poo, sweat, and breathe, so it is different for everybody, e.g. if you're a sweaty dude, drink more
- Alcohol is technically a macro-, the body burns alcohol as energy at 7 kcal/g, they contribute no essential nutrients, and alcohol is burned in the body before any of the other macronutrient energy sources, so if you eat lots of food and drink alcohol, some of that food excess energy will be stored as body fat, e.g. beer bellies

## Biochemistry of the Micronutrients
- "Minerals": really just other chemical elements found in food that humans need, not just minerals
  - Besides Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen, humans also need roughly 15-25 other elements (some are still beign debated) from the periodic table i.e. inorganic elements
  - Some are cofactors, others are electrolytes
    - Cofactors are elements that help amino acids create enzymes
    - Electrolytes are ions that help conduct electricity through the movement of the ion
  - Macrominerals (humans need > 150 mg/day): These are the big ones
    - Calcium: vital for health of muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems. Builds bone. Supports creation of blood cells. Helps contract muscles, nerve conduction, blood clotting. It's a beast.
    - Chlorine (as chloride ions): common electrolyte
    - Magnesium: required for processing ATP and related reactions, e.g. bone building, peristalsis, flexibility (woah), alkalinity.
      - Found in oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, legumes, chocolate, green leafy veggies
    - Phosphorous: required in bones, essential for energy processing, found in every cell, found in DNA/RNA/ATP/etc
      - Found in cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, etc.
    - Potassium: common electrolyte for heart and nerve function, with sodium maintains normal water balance in cells (the Na-K pump), acid-base balance, regulates neuromusclar activity
      - Found in bananas, avocados, nuts, veggies, potatoes, legumes, fish, mushrooms
      - Fun fact, if you get cramps while running, eating bananas can help fix this because they are high in potassium and it helps with neuromusclar activity
    - Sodium: common electrolyte, found in most foods as salt (sodium-chloride)
  - Microminerals: you need trace amounts, all of these help with chemical processes in the body with names longer than I feel like typing out
    - Cobalt, Copper, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Selenium, Zinc
      - Iodine is special and you need more of it, but not special enough to make the big leagues, get it in iodized salt and kombu
  - Ultratrace minerals: you need a tiny bit, maybe, we've yet to prove it
    - Bromine, Arsenic, Nickel, Flourine, Boron, Lithium, Strontium, Silicon, Vanadium
    - Seems like you can get most of these by opening up a computer and licking the parst (kidding don't sue me)
- Vitamins: essential for good health
  - There are thirteen essential vitamins. You gotta wonder what happened to Vitamins B4, B8, B10, B11, F, G, H, I, and J. 
    - Vitamin A (all-trans-retinols, all-trans-retinyl-esters, as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids)
    - Vitamin B1 (thiamine)
    - Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
    - Vitamin B3 (niacin)
    - Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)
    - Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)
    - Vitamin B7 (biotin)
    - Vitamin B9 (folic acid and folates)
    - Vitamin B12 (cobalamins)
    - Vitamin C (ascorbic acid and ascorbates)
    - Vitamin D (calciferols): can actually be created in the body in the presence of UVB radiation (sunlight, basically), so you don't always have to eat this if you get enough sunlight, I don't know what enough is
    - Vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols)
    - Vitamin K (phylloquinones, menaquinones, and menadiones)

## Frontiers of Nutritional Biochemistry
- Antioxidants
  - A common buzzword nowadays, these have not been shown to be essential to human nutrition because of poor bioavailability i.e. they get pee/pooed out
  - As per usual, it's all just bullshit marketing, follow the Mediterranean diet
- Intestinal microbiome / Gut flora
  - There are many tiny little bacteria, archaea, and fungi that help us with digestion. They are friends, not foe. They help digest food, produce fatty acids, and make vitamins available.
  - I don't have any recommendations here besides eat the... you guessed it, CARNIVORE diet! Haha, obviously not, follow the good ol' Mediterranean diet. Maybe add in some fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, soy sauce, beer? I dunno man. Seems like if you eat clean, these little dudes will be kept healthy.
  - Just like with everything, don't fall for the stupid marketing tricks, drinking kombucha is not going to make up for lack of vegetables and exercise.
