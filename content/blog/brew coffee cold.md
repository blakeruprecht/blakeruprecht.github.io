## 1. Why brew yourself?
Brewing coffee at home can save you quite a bit of money, while achieving the same great taste of the coffee shops. If, like me, you prefer to drink two large cups of coffee per day (equivalent to two medium cold-brews from a shop), that would cost something like $5-10 purchasing from a local coffee shop. If I need WiFi, sure, worth it, but if I just want the flavor and caffeine, brewing at home can save a considerable amount of money. To brew 16 *fl.oz* of coffee (my daily limit before I turn into a coffee bean myself), I use 1/3 of a 1 *lb* bag of coffee, which typically costs $8-$16 (low-end mass-produced grocery store brand to high-end local coffee roastery in a fancy paper bag). Assuming I splurge and spend $16 per bag, that works out to $16/3 or $5.33 per 64 *fl.oz* of home-made coffee. Drinking 16 *fl.oz* of this per day, I'm spending about $5.33/4 or $1.33 per day on my coffee intake, which works out to $0.67 per "medium" cold-brew coffee. If I buy the bulk coffee grounds from Costco, this price drops to something like $0.12! The local coffee shops near me sell this same amount of cold-brew for $4 at Starbucks, $5 at Fretboard (boujee local place), $3.50 at the school cafe, $4 at Shortwave (my favorite). And damn, I didn't even include the tips!

Basically, if you want to save $3-5 per cup of coffe, make it yourself. If you rarely drink coffee, it probably doesn't matter. If you're like me and love buying that sweet, sweet coffee shop coffee, that works out to 365 x $5 = $1825 per year. If your're the kind of person who likes to save thousands per year, for marginal extra work (10 mins per brew), read on.

## 2. How to brew well

**Water: 40% of the flavor**
Water is one of the two ingredients of coffee, so make sure you're using water that tastes good.

**Fresh beans: 40% of the flavor**
The next most important decision you have to make is which beans you use. Coffee beans come from all over, but the vast majority originate in tropical countries. This means lots of transport time and costs go into each bean, so if you can, find ethical, sustainably harvested beans. The added cost doesn't improve flavor. Otherwise, the roast style may matter to some people, but I generally just buy light or medium roast. Coffee beans begine to lose flavor slowly after they are roasted, I can't remember how fast, but generally, the fresher the roast, the better it will taste.

**Freshly ground: 10% of the flavor**
At this point, if you're using good water, and good beans, you'll achieve the vast majority of the flavor potential of your brewing setup. The final optimizations here are not really worth doing, unless you're passionate about the flavor. It's perfectly acceptable to pour Costco ground coffee into a jug with tap water to drink, I like it just fine. If you do want to go the extra mile, grinding your beans fresh is the next major step you can do to increase the flavor of your coffee. I used a simple blade grinder for years to achieve a coarse grind (not very consistent), and I've heard burr grinders are more consistent. Either works, both should cost well under $100, ideally used under $20. Coarse grind is recommended for cold brew, I forget why. The other important part is to grind the beans within 30 minutes of brewing (basically right before you put them in the water), to achieve maximum freshness, but if you grind them at the store the week before, that works fine. Don't worry, it'll still taste good if you have good beans.

**Brewing consistency: 10% of the flavor**
The last bit of dialing in your coffee flavor comes down to how you brew it. This is where I choose cold brew, due to the ease of brewing, cheap equipment, and consistent strong flavor with less bitter taste. Something about the brewing temperature affects the flavor of the coffee[^1], but I don't have a sensitive enough palate to tell, and I drink coffee daily. Honestly, it's not that important which method you pick, but I will not personally be buying a hundred dollar coffee maker to test out other methods, and especially no thousand dollar espresso machine. Here's my process from start to finish.

## 3. The process

0. **Gather tools and ingredients**. Found in the table below. The total cost for the tools should be less than $40. You don't need fancy lids for the jars, or carrying handles, and you can even make do with a different coarse coffee filter.
	1. *Coffee Beans* (ingredient): Ideally freshly roasted. Whole is ideal if you have a grinder, otherwise ground is good too.
	2. *Water* (ingredient): Fresh drinking water, no salt.
	3. *Brewing Jars* (tool): Two 64 fl.oz mason jars.
	4. *Coarse Coffee Filter* (tool): Stainless steel mesh filter, hard to find locally, I've purchased from Amazon.
	5. *Fine Coffee Filter* (tool): Cheese cloth from local store.
	6. *Rubber Band* (tool): Optional, secure cheese cloth to jar for easier filtering.

1. **Grind coffee beans**. (*Skip this step if you bought pre-ground*). Use a blade grinder, burr grinder, or whatever they have at your local grocery store where you buy your beans.

2. **Add grounds to the coarse filter**: Add 5.33 *oz* (1/3 of a 1 *lb* bag) of grounds to the coarse filter. If you don't have the coarse filter, add the grounds directly into the jar, you will filter them out later. I use 1/3 of the bag and dilute the coffee after, you can always add 4 *oz* if you want weaker cold-brew, or 8 *oz* if you want it stronger. Pick your own number, you will have to test it out a few times to determine what you like.

3. **Place ground and filter into jar**: Yeah, it should fit in quite nicely if both jar and filter are wide-mouth.

4. **Slowly fill jar with water**: Pour the water directly onto the grounds, making sure to soak the grounds thoroughly. Don't overflow the jar, so you may need to trickle water into the jar. Typically, this step takes the longest.

5. **Brew for 8-24 hours**. In a pinch, after about 8 hours it starts to taste like coffee. I typically brew overnight (8pm - 8am, roughly 12 hours), or for a full 24 hours. Past 24 hours, it starts to taste weird, dunno why. Shocking fact, the warmer the air temperature is for the "cold brew" process, the faster it will brew. Leave it in the fridge (roughly 37 *F*), and it will brew slower than leaving it at room temp (70 *F*). So if you're in a pinch, leave it on the counter. I'll brew it the morning before, leave it on the counter all day, then refrigerate it at night so it's cold when I drink it in the morning.

6. **Filter cold-brew from grounds**. You can drink it with the grounds if you like, but I do not, so I remove the coarse filter (with grounds) from the brewed coffee. Next, I bring out the second jar, and place the cheese cloth over the second jar forming a nice valley (opposite of a mountain) to act as a filter for the coffee. I attach the cheese cloth using a rubber band so I don't have to hold it, then I slowly pour my cold-brew though the cheese cloth from the first jar into the second jar. This way, I filter out any fine particles still left in the coffee, resulting in a much cleaner taste. Some even filter the cold-brew again through an even finer coffee filter, but this is far enough for me.

1. I looked up some papers referencing the taste variation in coffee brewing temperatures, and [this one](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/9/7/902)(1.1) discussed decreased acidity, lower concentration of browned compounds, and fewer total dissolved solids in *cold-brew* coffee. [This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34392-w)(1.2) stated "the hot brew coffees were found to have higher concentrations of total titratable acids, as well as higher antioxidant activity, than that of their cold brew counterparts." Shoutout to Rao and Fuller for actually studying cold brew coffee and getting published in Nature, one of the top journals in the world. Badass!
2. Interestingly, [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73341-4)(2.1) argued that a consistent hot-brew temperature wasn't very important, going against the conventional wisdom of coffee brewing certifiers. I love how science sometimes agrees with longstanding conventional wisdom, and sometimes blows it out of the (hot) water.
