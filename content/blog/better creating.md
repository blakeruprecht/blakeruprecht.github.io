# Note taking is procrastination!!!


--> In the same way that focusing on equipment in sports rather than playing is the sign of a fool, focusing on optimizing blogs and backend and website shit rather than just writing blog posts and getting them out there.



these notes are from [[2022-10-12]]
- Obsidian: storing atomic ideas -- idea quanta
- BlakeRuprecht.com: publishing posts for people to read (long-term blog)
- Reddit/Anonymous -- post random essays for random feedback on pure writing

- BLAKERUPRECHT.COM: personal website for resume, networking, etc.
- TWITTER.COM/BlakeRuprecht: random jokes, links to blog posts, find network opps
- INSTAGRAM.COM/BlakeRuprecht: photo updates for community

# Writing process
Write for 2-4 hours per day, in 25/5 pomodoros. Don't sit for more than 25 mins at a time, it's bad for your eyes and back.

1. Daily Log: the place for all scratch notes and new ideas, thoughts, daily ruminations, todo list. A place to dump all ideas and thoughts. Can also use a paper notebook for this, it doesn't fucking matter, just give yourself a place to dump ideas.
	- All of these notes should be archived
	- Before archiving, turn good ideas into Evergreen Notes and link them together
	- Before archiving, turn new references into Literature Notes
2. Inbox: place for all new ideas, these are the acorns that eventually sprout into evergreen trees.
3. Evergreen Notes: the place for all concept ideas, said as atomically as possible but also densely linked.
	- These form the basis of all writing, because all ideas should already be described with proper references.
4. Essays: The whole point of this process is to produce useful writing in the form of long-form essays, similar to Wait But Why. I want to generate as much useful content as I possibly can.

# Writing principles
- Winning bit is *# of words published*
- High-order bit for productivity is *dedicated writing time*
- Note-taking is for developing your own ideas, not for writing down other peoples ideas and collecting info. Those should be done separately.
- Writing evergreen notes helps insight accumulate, is a fundamental unit of knowledge-work, notes are concept-oriented; notes should be densely-linked
- The purpose isn't to write notes -- it's to improve learning/thinking and share useful pieces of writing to convey ideas/insights

Find a **problem**
Learn how to **solve it**
**Document** how you solved it
**Systemize** your process
**Share** your discoveries

-> Do it offline, it's called **growth**
-> Do it online, it's called **business**

# How to become a blogger.
- Accept that you max out at 4 hours a day, and actually try to hit that number
	- Measure yourself by what you've done though, not by the hours put in
	- Choose a particular time and place to work, and let nobody distract you
		- 10:00 - 14:00, four hours, NO distractions!
	- Work weekends for a 30% increase in work time, 28 vs. 20 hrs
	- Learn how to truly relax, recharge, and rebuild energy for writing those other 4 hrs a day
- Find sources of lasting intrinsic motivation
	- Don't trust your ego, you're not better or worse than anyone else
	- Do it because you care about something bigger than yourself
- Set up systems to track progress, not hours
	- e.g. 4 evergreen notes written per day
- Textbook method
	- Write everything you want to know about in your own words

# PUBLISH
1. DOWNLOAD and INSTALL the following programs:
	- Text Editor: Obsidian. Chosen because it stores files locally in markdown, is easy to use and minimal, easy to backup files to github, and i like the linking.
	- Version Control: Git. Chosen because it's the industry standard for version control and file saving, works great with plain-text files and github.
	- Storage: Github. I like it because it's free and easy to use, plus coming from C.S. I already know how to use it.
2. INITIATE a local vault in Obsidian or GIT CLONE your remote vault from Github
3. CONFIGURE Obsidian to continually backup vault to github using Obsidian Git plugin
- [ ] (TODO) 4. CREATE WordPress site on ?BlueHost?
