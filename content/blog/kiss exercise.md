title: KISS Calisthenics makes exercise easy
descript: '"There are many complicated exercise plans out there, but focusing on the fundamental movement patterns and nailing the basics is a timeless good idea."'

Check out [K Boges](https://www.youtube.com/@kboges) on Youtube, he explains this exercise theory better than I possibly could. All of his videos are very short, and he gets right to the point each time. A modern day youtube hero.


## Traininc Cardio
Perhaps the single most important thing to train for overall health is cardiovascular endurance, the ability of your heart and lungs to provide oxygen and energy to the entire body. There are three metabolic pathways: anaerobic, aerobic, and long-duration. These are also discussed as Zones, where (1=resting, 2-4=aerobic/long-duration, 5=anaerobic). I break it down into aerobic training and sprinting. Aerobic is anything faster than walking that elevates your heart rate, and sprinting is all-out.
- Walking is probably the single best thing to do for overall health, especially since it can be done anywhere. The tricky part with walking is you need to do a lot of it to reap the benefits, the 10k step goal is totally arbitrary but a good goal to shoot for.
- Further cardio training through running and other modalities is excellent to train Zone2 cardio. Sprinting and intense exercise is great to train the higher zones (3-5). Calisthenic exercise performed in high rep ranges trains cardio as well, the intensity determines the level.
## Training Muscles
Muscles adapt to training by increasing in strength, speed, power, endurance, size, and skill. There are muscles all over the body, but they can generally be categorized into upper body and lower body muscles (divided at the core). The upper body muscles mainly performing pushing and pulling movements. The lower body muscles move the legs for running, jumping, sprinting, lifting, etc. The core stabilizes the body during all of this.
- In general, bodyweight exercises (aka calisthenics) are safer for the average person to perform, can be trained everyday as a form of physical hygiene, and require substantially less equipment while delivering similar muscular development to weightlifting.
- Pushups totally train the upper body pushing musculature (chest, triceps, front delts). These should be the focus of all push training.
- Pullups totally train the upper body pulling musculature (lats, traps, biceps, rear delts). These should be the focus of all pull training.
- Legs are more complicated and should be trained using a greater variety of exercises, but still broken down into two main types:
	- Bilateral: Bodyweight squats, Kettlebell swings, Barbell squats, Barbell deadlifts, Two-leg jumping, etc.
	- Unilateral: Bodyweight lunges and split squats, Weighted lunges and split squats, Sprinting, One-leg jumping, etc.
- Core training is made simple by Dr. Stuart McGill, who recommends three exercises that are safe for anybody to perform, including those with lower back issues, and build a "weightlifting belt" around the core. Everybody knows about the abs in front, but the obliques on the side and lower-back muscles need to be trained as well.
	- Curl-ups: train the abs
	- Side planks: train the obliques
	- Bird dogs: train the glutes and spinal erectors

## Posture, Mobility, and Core
In addition to training the pushing, pulling, and leg muscles, many of us suffer from poor mobility due to sedentary/sitting lifestyles, so special focus should be made to improve posture, mobility, and core stiffness.
- Posture starts with proper breathing, so learn to nose-breath slowly and deeply the majority of your day (including sleep and mild cardio up to zone 2).
- Mobility of the joints is essential, but also a massive can of worms to open. I do not have the knowledge of a PT to teach every possible exercise that can be utilized to improve joint mobility. Seriously, strength training is the easy part, mobility and fixing mobility issues is a massively difficult topic. All I know are a few basics to get you started.
	- Ankles, knees, and hips can be mobilized using deep squat holds, 90/90 stretches, elephant stretches, and just generally ground rest. Sitting in a chair the majority of the day forces the hips, knees, and spine into one position that it doesn't love being in, leading to the next problem.
	- Most people who sit too much suffer from anterior pelvic tilt and/or lumbar lordosis, which requires some special training
		- Strengthen the abs: Curl-ups (don't forget the other two!)
		- Strengthen the glutes: Kb swings, Split squats, Lunges, etc.
		- Mobilize the hip flexors: Couch stretch
		- Mobilize the lower back: Cobra, Cat-Cow poses
	- Mobilize the upper body using full range of motion pushups and pullups, dips, strength exercises, and specific stretches to target weak points.
