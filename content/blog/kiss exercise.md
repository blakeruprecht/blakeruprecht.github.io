title: KISS exercise is Calisthenics
descript: '"There are many complicated exercise plans out there, but focusing on the fundamental movement patterns and nailing the basics is a timeless good idea."'

Check out [K Boges](https://www.youtube.com/@kboges) on Youtube, he explains this exercise theory better than I possibly could. All of his videos are very short, and he gets right to the point each time. A modern day youtube hero.


## Training Cardio
Perhaps the single most important thing to train for overall health is cardiovascular endurance, the ability of your heart and lungs to provide oxygen and energy to the entire body. There are three metabolic pathways: anaerobic, aerobic, and long-duration. These are also discussed as Zones, where (1=resting, 2-4=aerobic/long-duration, 5=anaerobic). I break it down into aerobic training and sprinting. Aerobic is anything faster than walking that elevates your heart rate, and sprinting is all-out.
- Walking is probably the single best thing to do for overall health, especially since it can be done anywhere. The tricky part with walking is you need to do a lot of it to reap the benefits, the 10k step goal is totally arbitrary but a good goal to shoot for.
- Further cardio training through running and other modalities is excellent to train Zone2 cardio. Sprinting and intense exercise is great to train the higher zones (3-5). Calisthenic exercise performed in high rep ranges trains cardio as well, the intensity determines the level.
## Training Muscles
Muscles adapt to training by increasing in strength, speed, power, endurance, size, and skill. There are muscles all over the body, but they can generally be categorized into upper body and lower body muscles (divided at the core). The upper body muscles mainly perform pushing and pulling movements using the arms. The lower body muscles move the legs for running, jumping, sprinting, lifting, etc. The core stabilizes the body during all of this.

In general, bodyweight exercises (aka calisthenics) are excellent choices to train the muscles. They are safe when done with proper form, can be trained everyday, and require minimal equipment.

**Pullups** are the best upper body pulling exercise, and train all of the pulling muscles: lats, traps, rhomboids, rear delts, and biceps. Pullups are difficult, and require great strength-to-weight ratio. If you can't do a pullup, pullup negatives, band-assisted pullups, and inverted rows are a great way to build the back strength necessary to start training pullups.

**Pushups** are the best upper body pushing exercise, and train all of the pushing muscles: upper and lower chest, front delts, and triceps. These also require a good strength-to-weight ratio, so resting on the knees instead of the feet is a great way to work up to more difficult variations. I would be remiss to not mention **dips**, which are similarly effective to pushups, but train the triceps and lower chest more.

**Squats** are the king of all exercises, and train the glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves, while also improving hip, knee, and ankle mobility. Squats improve leg strength and jumping ability, but jumping is a great leg exercise in its own right. The legs are very dynamic and benefit from single-leg exercises like lunges and sprinting too. If you have access to weights, I would recommend throwing in barbell squats, barbell split squats, barbell romanian deadlifts (or dumbbell versions), and kettlebell swings to really hammer the legs.

**Core** training is made simple by Dr. Stuart McGill, who came up with three core exercises that are safe for anybody to perform, even those with lower back and mobility issues. These three variations were chosen to build a "weightlifting belt", a strong stable core. Unlike situps, which waste half the movement training the hip flexors, these movements don't cause indirect harm to mobility or the back. Many people do ab training, but neglect the obliques and lower back.
- Curl-ups: train the abs without targeting the hip flexors, unlike situps.
- Side planks: train the obliques
- Bird dogs: train the glutes and spinal erectors

## Posture, Mobility, and Core
In addition to training the pushing, pulling, and leg muscles, many of us suffer from poor mobility due to sedentary/sitting lifestyles, so special focus should be made to improve posture, mobility, and core stiffness.
- Posture starts with proper breathing, so learn to nose-breath slowly and deeply the majority of your day (including sleep and mild cardio up to zone 2).
- Mobility of the joints is essential, but also a massive can of worms to open. I do not have the knowledge of a PT to teach every possible exercise that can be utilized to improve joint mobility. Seriously, strength training is the easy part, mobility and fixing mobility issues is a massively difficult topic. All I know are a few basics to get you started.
	- Ankles, knees, and hips can be mobilized using deep squat holds, 90/90 stretches, elephant stretches, and just generally ground rest. Sitting in a chair the majority of the day forces the hips, knees, and spine into one position that it doesn't love being in, leading to the next problem.
	- Most people who sit too much suffer from anterior pelvic tilt and/or lumbar lordosis, which requires some special training
		- Strengthen the abs: Curl-ups (don't forget the other two!)
		- Strengthen the glutes: Kb swings, Split squats, Lunges, etc.
		- Mobilize the hip flexors: Couch stretch
		- Mobilize the lower back: Cobra, Cat-Cow poses
	- Mobilize the upper body using full range of motion pushups and pullups, dips, strength exercises, and specific stretches to target weak points.
