title: KISS Calisthenics makes exercise easy
descript: '"There are many complicated exercise plans out there, but focusing on the fundamental movement patterns and nailing the basics is a timeless good idea."'

Check out [K Boges](https://www.youtube.com/@kboges) on Youtube, he explains this exercise theory better than I possibly could. All of his videos are very short, and he gets right to the point each time. A modern day youtube hero.

## Training Cardio & Muscles
My takeaway from his extensive knowledge is summarized here, I don't want to explain further because I'm not an expert, so look to Boges for more info if you are curious.
- Walking is probably the single best thing to do for overall health, especially since it can be done anywhere
- Pushups are the single best movement to train the entire upper-body pushing musculature (chest, triceps, front delts).
- Pullups are the single best movement to train the entire upper-body pulling musculature (lats, traps, bicpes, rear delts).
- Bodyweight exercises are safer, easier on the joints and tendons, and can be trained everyday as a form of physical hygiene. Of course, lifting is wonderful too, and can be incorporated into any strength training routine if you are knowledgeable, but at the very least, calisthenics is a great start, and can take any individual very far.
- Similarly, the entire lower body can be trained using bodyweight Squat and Lunge variations, plus Sprinting

## Posture, Mobility, and Core
In addition to training the muscles, many of us suffer from poor mobility due to sedentary/sitting lifestyles, so special focus should be made to improve posture, mobility, and core stiffness.
- Posture starts with proper breathing, so learn to nose-breath slowly and deeply the majority of your day (including sleep and mild cardio).
- Mobility of the joints is essential, so mobilize your ankles, knees, hips, core, and shoulders to make sure they can go through all of the proper motions.
	- Stretch the hip-flexors using couch stretch, stretch the hamstrings using elephant stretch, stretch the inner leg muscles, stretch the lower-back using cat-camel & snake pose.
- Strengthen core stiffness using the McGill big 3: Curl ups, Bird dogs, and Side planks.
- Strengthen the glutes using glute bridges and deep squat holds.
