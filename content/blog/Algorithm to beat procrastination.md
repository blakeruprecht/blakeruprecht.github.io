## Algorithm to beat procrastination
$$ Motivation = \frac{Expectancy \cdot Value}{Impulsiveness \cdot Delay} $$
Step 1: Notice I'm procrastinating
	- I know I *should* do a task

Step 2: Guess which unattacked part of the equation is causing me the most trouble.
	- Low Expectancy: am I likely to succeed? Is the task within my capabilities? Will I actually get the reward?
	- Low Value: am I bored and distracted? Uncomfortable, onerous, or painful? Am I nervous or afraid of the outcome? Do I care about the task?
	- Delay: how much reward is delayed, and for how long?
	- Impulsiveness: am I impatient? Distracted?
	- Should I drop/delegate this task?

3. Try several methods for attacking the specific problems.
	- Low Expectancy
		- Start with process/learning tasks to begin [[Success spirals]]
		- Surround yourself with inspiration and optimists for more [[Vicarious victory]]
		- [[Mental contrasting]] where you are now with where you want to be.
		- Plan for the worst, expect the best
	- Low Value
		- *Reward* becaues humans are animals, use rewards to reinforce good behavior.
		- Focus on what you love, wherever possible.
		- *Flow*: if the task is boring, try to make it more difficult up to the point of creating flow
		- *Meaning*: remember the chain of meaning that makes a specific task relevant to your over-arching goals, e.g. this homework gets me PhD which gets me writing job which gets me ability to help people
		- *Energy*: do things to increase your mental energy.
	- Delay
		- decrease delay
		- chunk the task to get more rewards.
	- Impulsiveness
		- use precommitment
		- Set specific and meaningful goals and subgoals
		- Measure your behavior
		- Build useful habits.
