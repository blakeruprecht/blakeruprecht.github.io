## Tit-for-tat is the best strategy
In a game theory type game, choose *cooperation* as your default, starting strategy. If your fellow player also cooperates, continue cooperating. As soon as the other cheats against you, you cheat against them the next time. Keep cheating. If they go back to cooperating, you go back. Tit-for-tat beats all other strategies. It drove the other strategies into extinction. It's retaliatory, it's clear-cut, it's forgiving. It's perfect!

It may lose the battles, but it wins all the wars. It has a *vulnerability*. Forgiving tit-for-tat has a vulnerability against players who do not forgive so easily. A better strategy became apparent.

Stickleback fish, a notoriously dumb type of fish, are capable of applying tit-for-tat strategy in cooperative/competitive games. Remember, [[Tit-for-tat is the best strategy in cooperative games]].
