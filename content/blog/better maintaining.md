There are a lot of habits we do each day which fall under the category of "Maintenance". Sure, sleeping and eating could be in this category, but they are such important habits that they require more information. The rest of this stuff is relatively unimportant individually, but collectively, can help or hurt your life. Either way, I don't think about this stuff much, I'm terrible at all things medical, and I want to spend as little time possible "maintaining" my body and environment as possible. As always, a [[better mindset]] helps a lot to actually enjoy this stuff.
## Internal Medicine
- **Check ups**. At least once a year for a regular check-up that does bloodwork I'm assuming? Haven't done this for five years or so.
## **Eyes**
- **Sunglasses**. Every optometrist I've ever talked to has told me to wear sunglasses as much as possible.
- **Stretching**. Vary the optical length of your eyes every 20 mins if you're staring at something at a fixed distance (e.g. reading, computer use). To do this, look at something 20 feet away, then 200 feet away (middle and long distance) to flex the focal length of your eyes.
- **Check ups**. I wear contacts/glasses, so I need to go once per year to the eye doctor to get checked out.
## **Teeth**
- **Vitamins**. A lot of tooth and gum health is based on eating plenty of micronutrients, espeically vitamin C. So first, [[better eating]].
- **Toothbrushing**. Brush your teeth softly twice per day (morning and night). If you brush too hard, you remove protective enamel from your teeth, causing them to yellow and be weaker. This is a great opportunity to practice mindfulness daily.
- **Floss**. *At least* once per day, my dentists always recommend twice, but I've only managed to incorporate 1 as a habit.
- **Check ups**. Most dentists recommend every six months, which seems self-serving, but I guess I'll trust them.
## **Skin**
- **Shower**. As needed, typically daily. Use natural soap, no need for crazy products. Don't use super hot water, and end the shower with as cold water as possible to refresh you.
- **Face**. Wash face twice per day (morning and night) to remove oils and shit from the skin. The ONLY products that could potentially be worth it are sunscreen in the morning (seems legit), and moisturizer twice per day (still unsure about this one).
- **Check ups**. My family has a history of skin cancer, so I have to go at least once a year to get moles removed and skin cancers removed. Fun.
## Hair
- **Soap**. Shampoo and conditioner are bogus, just use normal soap.
- **Haircuts**. Why pay $20+ once a month when you can just learn one haircut for the rest of your life? It's easy to cut your own hair.
