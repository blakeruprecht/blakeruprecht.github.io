There are really only two things in life -- the pain of action, and the pain of inaction
- The pain of action / the pleasure of long-term
	- blunt, in your face, forces you to grow
	- restore order
	- doesn't reduce pain, but you take it on the chin
	- you sign up for it up front, willingly
	- because of voluntary acceptance, day after day, we gain the strength to shoulder it
	- by embracing pain, instead of running from it, we are transformed by it
	- we become better, giving meaning ot the pain
	- feeling of growth and progress gives the suffering a purpose
- The pain of inaction / the pleasure of short-term
	- a poison
	- slow-burning, draining your will, decaying your soul
	- things disentegrate, entropy
	- by letting ourselves go, we lose self-respect
	- inaction is the holiday of fools, who trade temporary discomfort for long-term, existential suffering
		- what's the point of existing?
- ACTION is a life-giving breath; INACTION is a slow death
