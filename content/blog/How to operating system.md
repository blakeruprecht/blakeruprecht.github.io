Okay, so you now have a computer (honestly you probably had one already and skipped [How to select a good computer](How to computer)), what OS? Kidding, I know that most computers already come with an Operating System, so good news -- it's probably fine to just stick with what you've got, they're all pretty good these days.

# MacOS - a good Unix-style OS
If you buy a Macbook and it comes with MacOS, keep it. Otherwise it's pretty hard to get MacOS. It's nothing special compared to Linux, it's actually just very similar. It's a great operating system for most people. You can always dual-boot Windows or Linux later, for free, if you choose to. Or switch completely to one of the other two.

Really the only way to get MacOS is to buy an Apple laptop. You could try to make a Hackintosh, but this guide isn't for that. Just think of MacOS as very similar to Linux (they're both from the Unix family of OSs for the history nerds), so they're practically interchangeable. At least as far as software goes.

## Linux - a free Unix-style OS
If your computer doesn't come with an OS, [download Linux](simple-software). Linux is free, the code is open source (actually a good thing, it means more great coders are looking at the source code regularly and fixing bugs and vulnerabilities -- the key to software security is reaction time), making it extremely simple, fast, and lightweight. Modern flavors like Ubuntu and CentOS have easy to use interfaces. Downside, it's tough to install if you don't already know how, but fun to learn for tech people.

Also, Linux is always free to download and is developed worldwide by some of the best programmers out there. It's truly an amazing social feat of humanity.

## Windows - a necessary evil 
If you already have Windows, cool. It's a good OS, and is widely used in industry. The major distinction in the software world is between Windows and Unix. MacOS and Linux are both Unix-style operating systems, meaning they revolve around the command line and have a similar file structure. 

Here's the reality of the world -- Unix is better for software people because it's simpler and cleaner, Windows is better for the business world because it's effective and works "good enough." Any good computer programmer or scientist can use both, because they're still quite similar.
