An Ode to:
- Magicians
- Witches
- Wizards
- Alchemists
- and mostly -- Brewers

It's a magical little potion, so simple and sweet,
Made out of barley, hops, and sometimes wheat.
Drink it out of a can, a bottle, or a algass,
A little loosens you up, a lot puts you on your ass.
It takes lives, it makes lives, sometimes it makes you whole,
But you don't know when to stop, you don't know when to slow.
Keep going, keep drinking, keep chugging they say,
But then they say nothing, they've all gone away.

You're left with your glasses, your bottles and cans,
With no one to tell you what to do,
To follow through on all those half-hearted plans.

You're left to rot in the dark, full of barley and yeast,
What a magical little potion, so simple and bitter.
