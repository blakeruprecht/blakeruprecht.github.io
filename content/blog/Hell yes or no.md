For any big decision, if you can't decide what to do and are debating between yes and no, then the answer is no. You should only say YES if you are certain in the answer. If you make spreadsheets, write out pro/con lists, and overanalyze the decision, don't commit. Don't lock yourself into a long term decision if you're not truly sure you want to do it. Don't make life decisions on the margins. More than likely, you're indecisive because you're considering the opinions of others too much or you have some fear of missing out, not because you truly love the YES option. Anything you truly love, you'll say "Hell Yes!" to. If you're afraid of saying yes, remember that sometimes fear can guide us, so [[Choose love over fear, shame, and impulse]], but more than likely, the decision should be no.

In making decisions this way, you give yourself clear decisions to learn from. Instead of making a YES decision with 60% confidence and only half-committing, make the NO decision and commit to that. You'll pretty quickly realize if you were right or wrong, and more often than not, you'll be right.
