## Wisdom is in the doing
One of the most important principles in life is this: wisdom is in the doing. What this means is that wisdom can never be attained from sitting back and watching, but only by attempting to do something. In practice, it's better to learn from mistakes and failures than it is to never try. I think of the old saying "the master has failed more than the beginner has ever tried". Whenever I've been good at things in my life, this has been my gold standard advice to people. How did you get so good at XYZ? By trying and trying and failing over and over again. It's simple really. Quantity of repetition. Similarly, [[Winning requires ability, practice, and love]]
