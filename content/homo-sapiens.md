"Wise man"

In the Game of [[Life]], experience has shown that the group of animals that wield sharp sticks and even sharper brains are literally the Greatest Of All Time species to walk this Earth.


Man evolved from other primates, and for a long time, there were other humanoids walking the Earth, like the Neanderthals, Denisovans, H. Erectus (haha), and more.

In the game of evolution... humans DOMINATE.
Ez S-tier.
