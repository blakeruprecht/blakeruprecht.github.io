title = "About this site"
+++

**Hand made**. I coded this website by hand using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (the basics). The content is managed by a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that converts markdown (.md) files to HTML (.html). I previously made a lot more features like menus, day/night mode, etc, but I like websites that are as simple as possible.

**Minimal design**. Grayscale, minimal, and using the font NotoSans so that "AI" looks like two uppercase letters and not the name Al.

**Free and open source**. The source code of this website is freely and openly availably at [this Github Repo](https://github.com/blakeruprecht/blakeruprecht.github.io) under the MIT license. [Free and Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (FOSS) is punk, anti-capitalist, anti-ownership, anti-privatiziation, pro-freedom, pro-sharing economy, post-scarcity, and pro commons-based peer production.

**Github Pages hosting**. I host this website for free on Github as part of their Github Pages service, which enables anybody with an account to host one website for free. Pretty sweet!

**Squarespace domain**. I got the domain from Squarespace Domains (formerly Google), and hooked it up to Github Pages using DNS records.
