Reading is fun. And a fun way to keep learning new things.
- My [videoshelf](/videoshelf) of favorite movies, tv shows, etc
- My **podshelf** is just 1 right now:
	- **Hardcore History by Dan Carlin** (podcast) - Carlin expands what podcasts can do with well-researched, multi-hour epics on topics like the First World War, Japan before WWII, and Painfotainment, the history of human torture as entertainment. My only gripe is that my travels aren't long enough to finish an entire series in one trip.
