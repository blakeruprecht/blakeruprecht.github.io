Humans need to [breathe](/breathe), [move](/move), [rest](/rest), [nourish](/nourish), and [relate](/relate) to survive. We are the only animals that require tools to survive. We need tools to help us move, like clothing. We need tools to rest, like shelter and fire. We need tools to hunt animals, process plants, and make fire to cook over. We need tools to store our food and other supplies we gather. We need tools to relate with other humans, like language, writing, and smartphones.

We can perform labor to gain these resources directly, e.g. go into the woods and collect wood to make fire, build bow and arrows, build structures, etc. Or we can perform labor to gain money, an indirect representation of resources. Either way, we work to gain tools to accomplish our survival needs.
