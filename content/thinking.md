You actions reveal your real values.

Two responses:
1. Stop lying to yourself and admit your real priorities.
2. Start doing what you say you want to do to see if it's really true.

Overthinking is a loop. Break the loop by:
1. **Stop storytelling**. Stop trying to figure it out. Behavior comes from competing subsystems, not unified decisions. E.g. use emotions for social cues, logic for planning, etc. Don't force agreement between systems. The narrator creates coherent stories after actions happen to maintain the **illusion of control** -- the biggest illusion in life.
2. **Act anyway**. Build trigger-action systems that bypass willpower. Build systems and environments instead of motivation.
3. **Track results**. Log behavior. Measure outcomes. What was the action, what feelings did it lead to? Treat desire as data to track, not a mystery.
4. **Adjust & Repeat**. Don't explain what you want. Optimize for getting it anyway. Desire is input, not mystery. Identity is response patterns in context. Optimize for results, not self-concept. Track what works. Build around actual tendencies. Operate first. Narrate only if useful.

No self. No why. Just what works.
