## Process to act, not think
Overthinking is a loop. Break the loop by pointing attention outward: What actually happens? What works?

1. **Drop the story**. Name it "story." Stop analyzing motives. Stop trying to figure out why you do what you do. Your behavior comes from competing subsystems, not unified decisions. The narrator creates coherent stories after actions happen to maintain the *illusion of control.* Use emotions for social cues, logic for planning. Don't force agreement between systems.
2. **Act anyway**. Build trigger-action systems that bypass willpower. Build systems and environments instead of motivation.
3. **Track results**. Log behavior. Measure outcomes. What was the action, what feelings did it lead to? Treat desire as data to track, not a mystery.
4. **Adjust & Repeat**. Don't explain what you want. Optimize for getting it. Desire is input, not mystery. Identity is response pattersn in context. Optimize for results, not self-concept. Track what works. Build around actual tendencies. Operate first. Narrate only if useful.

No self. No why. Just what works.
