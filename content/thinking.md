Stop thinking. Start doing. Adjust as you go.

The purpose of thinking is action, not more thinking.

Give us this day our **daily bread**, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those, who sin against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom and the power and glory forever, amen."
