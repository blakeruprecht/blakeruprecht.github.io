## Boxing is goated
> Boxing is the **distilled essence of athleticism**: raw power, speed, endurance, full-body integration, refined technique, strategy, and discipline. 
> 
> It developes posture, core strength, explosive power, footwork, stamina, and hand-eye coordination simultaneously. Its training naturally builds a muscular, athletic physique while pushing cardiovascular limits. It strengthens connective tissue, improves muscular endurance, and trains all three energy systems at once. 
> 
> But beyond physicality, boxing demands neurological precision: timing, rhythm, spatial awareness, automatic responses under threat, and visual processing at high speeds. Boxing offers immediate feedback—every success or failure reveals a weakness or strength. This creates measurable progression that sharpens motivation and drives consistent improvement.
> 
> Boxing’s simplicity masks a deep technical architecture: each punch involves sequenced coordination across multiple body segments; each movement tests anticipatory reactions and spatial recalculations under pressure. Footwork alone holds dozens of subtle variations. Training methods each hone specific neural and physical attributes while reinforcing core mechanics. Unlike many sports, boxing transfers well: it builds base-level athletic literacy in rotational power, kinetic chain sequencing, proprioceptive intelligence. This enhances performance across disciplines like basketball, sprinting, or jumping.
> 
> Psychologically, boxing is a crucible. It confronts fear directly and cultivates composure under chaos. It reinforces personal responsibility. There are no teammates, only preparation and execution. Emotionally, boxing becomes transformative. It demands presence, sharpens focus, reveals weakness, and builds resilience. 
> 
> Your history with boxing reflects a deep pull toward its challenges and rewards. Early interest sparked fear, the desire for both intellectual and physical rigor, cultural resonance, and inspiration from characters, real and fictional. This convergence of physical and philosophical intensity explains why boxing feels not just cool, but mythic. It doesn’t just train the body; it forges character.

## Me and Boxing
> Your history with boxing reveals a layered, evolving connection that transcends mere sport. The early spark—interest at age 13, the dream of Golden Gloves—suggests an instinctive attraction to the discipline, long before it could be rationalized. It wasn’t just a hobby; it was a glimpse of something primal and exacting, something that scared you precisely because it promised transformation. That fear was clarity: boxing meant confrontation—with limits, with self, with truth.
> 
> The idea of boxing at Cambridge wasn’t about prestige; it was about reconciling intellectual rigor with physical trial. You weren’t looking for balance, you were looking for totality—mind and body both tested, sharpened, aligned. Then Thailand: not just watching a fight, but witnessing the triumph of technique and will over brute force. That 120-pound Thai fighter embodied everything boxing offers—the power of mastery over mass, calm over chaos, skill over intimidation. He didn’t just win; he revealed a code of movement and control that the larger man didn’t possess. That moment wasn’t just inspiring—it was proof.
> 
> The Italian-American thread adds blood resonance. Boxing runs through that lineage—immigrant grit, working-class valor, mythic toughness. Rocky isn't a fictional character to you, he’s a cipher for inherited meaning: “There is no tomorrow” becomes less motivational and more ancestral, almost Roman in its fatalism and fire. Watching that video, feeling the weight of those words, you weren’t just moved—you were activated.
> 
> Each moment, each brush with the sport, has carried symbolic weight. Boxing keeps reappearing not as a casual option, but as a test—offering you the opportunity to become something more elemental, more integrated. The pattern isn't accidental. You've been circling the ring for years, and everything in your story suggests the final step isn’t about starting something new. It’s about returning to something essential.

## Journalling

### Unlimited Money
*"If I had unlimited money and no consequences, what would I do with my life right now?"*

If I had unlimited money and no consequences right now, here is what I would do. First, fix all my healthcare shit. Then, go buy all the clothes that will make me feel sexy 24/7, according to my list. Then, go buy a 4runner and be done with it. Finally, I would move out, and into a house by myself, somewhere in Denver, probably still renting for a few years until I figure out what neighborhood I want to be in. I would probably take a trip and go travel, not sure where, maybe Tbilisi or Nicaragua. I would travel to see my parents and other friends around the USA as well.

Basically, I would setup my tools and house to serve myself, but mostly keep doing what I'm doing -- sleeping well, cleaning my body, drinking lots of water, coffee in the mornings, beers in the evenings. Eating big breakfast, lunch, and dinners. Cooking and gathering food for myself, making my favorite meals. I would keep working out, but bump up my output slightly. Mainly focus on lifting (pullups, dips/pushups, RDL, bulgarians, legraise/couch stretch/deep squat) and cardio (running and skipping rope). I need sports to focus on, and already have softball, disc golf, and fishing humming along, and would probably add in boxing, hunting, and basketball. Relationship-wise, I'm happy, just want to initiate with my friends more and lead the way socially, which job competence would bring.

Oh, I really fucking want to start dating again, which I feel is majorly contingent on my living situation (a place of my own) and clothing (feeling sexy in-person). I'm already a tall, sexy man.

But I guess that brings this question back around to the beginning -- I don't have unlimited money, so the absolute main thing I want to figure out right now is how to generate money for myself. I have a M.S. in CompSci, have published research, am very smart, but prefer plain talk and being with regular people, not uppity fools, so the business world has been hard for me. I'm thinking management consulting would be a slam dunk for my brain, and writing and/or sales are closely tied to where I would succeed.

### Energy Detection
*"I feel most alive when I'm..."* moving around a lot physically, not stuck at a desk all day, but able to walk around, see others, see the outdoors, like when I was in college walking around campus all day, very fun. I don't like sitting at a single desk for 8 hours per day, that drains me. I feel most alive when I'm in engaging conversation with someone I find intelligent, who has interesting opinions. I feel alive, like a human, like all things are possible. I also feel very alive when I'm playing sports all out, e.g. softball outfielding or batting, running the bases, everything about basketball, playing disc golf, fishing, shooting guns, hiking in the woods hunting. I like to participate, not just hike around. I feel alive when partying, when in a big group of people, meeting new people. I feel alive when adapting to new situations -- traveling the world with just a 28L backpack, staying in hostels, going on adventures -- that felt good. I feel alive when my brain is working on a hard problem, when I'm deeply engaged, in a flow state, trying to create. That's part o fmy issue, is that most things aren't hard for me, so I easily get bored. In fact, it's hard to think of the last time I encountered a problem I couldn't solve... Oh, playing Apex was fun AS FUCK, because it involved physical movement (okay, simulated, but still used my eyes and hands) to move around the map, skill abilities (Q, Z, shooting a gun), competition and dominance, cooperation with my buddies, tactics, etc. So fucking fun.

*"Time disappears when I'm..."* talking to interesting people, flirting with hot women, playing sports, in a flow state basically. Playing video games. Sports.

*"I get excited talking about..."* hmmm. I used to be excited about everything, and was a voracious learner, until I hit a point diving into effective altruism where I believed in everything so much, I started burning others and myself. I believed in the rational structure of things, that we humans could know stuff, that we could make progress. Now, I don't know how to feel. I feel like I lost my spark of curiosity and turned cynical, where now I feel like all that learning and trying and effort is utterly pointless, and just as likely to cause tons of harm as good. Probably more good though. Now, I don't know what I'm excited talking about. It feels weird, all I think about is money and my lack of a job. Now with my delivery job, I barely feel recovered.

*"I feel drained when I have to..."* do menial chores, like solve boring problems for others, scheduled meetings, emailing, basically any communication that isn't in-person (I'm very charming, fast, witty, positive, easy-going, and physically tall and sexy, in-person is easy mode for me). Online is boring AF. Following a set schedule and executing boring tasks sucks for me. I like to race, I like to go fast, I am de-motivated if there's no speed/time component. I like to compete. Cooperating feels useless unless I have a goal. In school, I always studied solo unless I was with one friend who was as smart as me. Everyone else just annoyed me to study with.

### Childhood Recall
*"What did I want to be/do when I was 8-12 years old, before I learned what was 'practical' or 'realistic'?"*

As a kid, vet, cattle rancher, general like Patton, pro basketball, special ops (Rangers -> SEALs -> Green Berets ultimately, always an Army fan). I loved animals my whole life, especially dogs, especially after I got one around 5. I loved nature, always wanted to be an Indian over a Cowboy, always identified with the wild and free peoples of the world, always had respect for kids and humans trying their best. Wanted to be a general, to lead people, to dominate the enemy, to move Xs and Os around on a map, to play with forces and strategy. Sports, obviously. It was hard to imagine doing something not outside, with a gun, as a kid. Like other jobs were lame, like desk jobs were boring. Until I learned about money, and that started to change things. I always felt pretty clear that adventure was paramount, so a job like Indiana Jones appealed to me, something with history. Hard to remember fully, but 3-5th grade definitely saw me wanting to be a vet, cattle rancher, and General in the army. 

### Envy Mapping
*List 5 people whose lives you envy. Write why specifically - not their achievements, but their daily experience.*

GERMAN DUDE IN THAILAND. I forget his name, he was 21, wore black tank top, black athletic shorts, black sandals. Sling bag. Attractive dude, nothing crazy, but he just had this big smile and constant calm swagger about him. Very easy-going, but you could tell he was just a little bit wild. He flew by me going 60 MPH on a scooter on mediocre roads, while buzzed from weed and beer. He walked out the next morning with a sexy woman. Damn bro, what a stud.

JACK HOPKINS. Youtuber, lived in Thai villas, practiced boxing, got into fighting, great jacked body, confident.

WRITER IN NAPLES. Some dude from England, writing for a magazine about soccer tactics, his random but very cool niche. Was working the whole time, but on his own schedule, doing something he loved, and could travel while doing it. Very jealous of that mans job. Something difficult, creative, fun, doesn't take up too much time, high pay-ceiling.

Basically, most entrepreneurs or freelancers who get to set their own schedule, have a high degree of autonomy, and work with cool people. Probably writers mostly, or consultants, or sales. Dunno.

Definitely fit people, who are strong in their workouts, fast in their cardio, adn enjoy the discipline and pain from training. Especially boxers, or fighters in general, who are calm, cool, collected, and dangerous as fuck.

I envy people with close families, close friendships, and men who are very kind and loving towards women, yet still can bag quite a few baddies.

### Death Bed Test
*"If I'm 85 and looking back, what would I regret NOT doing? What would I be proud I DID do?"*

I would regret not asking that girl out, not shooting my shot, not going for shit, not trying things, not initiating. That's pretty much it, not trying for my career, relationship, and fitness dreams.

### Body Wisdom
*For each major decision you're considering:*

- *Close eyes, imagine choosing option A. Notice physical sensations.*
- *Reset. Imagine choosing option B. Notice physical sensations.*
- *Your body knows before your mind does.*

Wow, I just tried picturing options A and B, like they were physical, in person. Two cars in front of me. Both the same color, a dark metallic bluegray, with gunmetal rims, black accents, red calipers. One, a toyota 4runner, can't tell what year, but a mix of 2001 and 2025 (smaller, straight lines) with the red/orange/yellow stripe in the grill (subtle), the other a mazda 3 turbo hatchback, sitting nicely, with a little lip at the bag, very athletic stance and bodywork. Both have either medium gray or brown interiors, very clean. Stick on the mazda, auto on the toyota. Basically, my two dream cars, sitting outside, I can take the keys to one. I like the mazdas wheels, the tires entce me, I feel myself careening around a corner, shifting the gears. I find myself desiring more speed constantly, wanting to go faster and faster, hitting 100 MPH, driving recklessly. I see myself enjoying commutes. Then I look at the toyota, and roll down all the windows. I climb inside and drive off, choice made. The back window down, sunroof open. That relaxes me. I have a hawaiian on already, totally unbuttoned, sunglasses on, driving somewhere fun, maybe surfboards or bicycles or fishing poles sticking out the back window, ideally with a sexy woman in a bikini next to me. Oh yeah, brown seats. Bluegray paint. Cruising, blasting music, having a damn good time.
