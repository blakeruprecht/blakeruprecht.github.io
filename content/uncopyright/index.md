Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is software that is available under a license that grants the right to use, modify, and distribute the software, modified or not, to everyone free of charge. All of the source code of this website is freely available at [this Github Repo](https://github.com/blakeruprecht/blakeruprecht.github.io) under a GPL license.

FOSS is basically an attempt to create an economy of abundance by doing away with ownership regulations. It counters neoliberalism and privatization, and it promotes solarpunk. It is moving towards commons-based peer production, free content, a sharing economy, and a post-scarcity economy.

There are four freedoms associated with FOSS:

0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
1. The freedom to study the source code, and change it how you wish.
2. The freedom to redistribute copies to others.
3. The freedom to distribute your modified version to others.
