Let's discuss a modern chatbot like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, etc.

At it's foundation, an AI is a computer program. What this means is that an AI receives input data, calculates math equations in real time, and outputs actions, all in a continuous loop operating as fast as the computer it is running on.

So it's a computer program -- it's made out of code. It runs on [computer](computer.md): phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, supercomputers.

- AI is a [program](/program) that is continually running -- receiving data from it's environment, whatever that happens to be, calculating probabilities about the data, and outputting actions into the environment. For a chatbot, this looks like a learning algorithm that receives text from many data sources, and tries to predict hidden parts of that very same text.
- AI is a series of coding instructions, or lines of code.
