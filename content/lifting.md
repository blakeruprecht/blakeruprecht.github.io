I train my muscles using general calisthenic principles that apply regardless of what gym I have access to. Bodyweight, rings, barbells, dumbbells, anything. Nothing fancy. Master the basics. Make number go up.

The only way to imrpove at lifting is by *progressively overloading* the muscles. Basically, lift more. More weight (same reps), more reps (same weight), or more speed (lift faster or reduce rest). The program doesn't matter, just the results. All that matters is whether or not you are adding weights/reps/speed over time. If your numbers are going down, your program is a waste of time.

Here are some general guidelines for lifting:
- *Fundamental Lifts* - These five categories cover all muscles.
	- *Pull* - back, shoulders, & biceps, e.g. Pullups, Rows
	- *Push* - chest, shoulders, & triceps, e.g. Dips, Pushups, Bench Press
	- *Squat* - quads, glutes, hams, e.g. Squat, Split Squat, Lunge
	- *Hinge* - hams, glutes, low back, e.g. Deadlift, RDL
	- *Core* - abs, obliques, low back, e.g. Plank, Dead Bug, Side Plank, Carry
- *Form* - Perfect form every time, non-negotiable. Quality over quantity.
- *Frequency* - 1-7 training sessions per lift per week
- *Sets*: 5-20 sets per week
- *Reps*: 1-30 for strength/power/speed, 30+ for endurance
- *Recovery*: You can't improve the muscles without recovering. This means:
	- [Sleeping](/sleeping) plenty each night (this is where muscle is built)
	- [Drinking](/drinking) plenty of water each day
	- [Eating](/eating) a surplus of **energy** and **protein**, and plenty of micronutrients

So yeah, in general, do one of each lift every week and add more sets/reps/frequency if numbers aren't going up. Most likely, sleeping/eating is the cause of poor performance, not bag programming.
