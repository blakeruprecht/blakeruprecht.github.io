3 TIMES PER WEEK, ANY ORDER
- 3x8-12 Pull -- mainly Pullups
- 3x8-12 Push -- mainly Dips and Pushups
- 3x8-12 Legs -- rotate variations
- 3x8-12 Core -- rotate variations

- [Compound Lifts](/compound-lifts) cover all major muscles. I rotate between a few I like:
	- Pull - Pullup, Pullups with other grips, Rows
	- Push - Dip, Pushup, Decline Pushup, Db Incline Bench
	- Legs - Squat, RDL, Glute Bridge
	- Core - Plank, Dead Bug, Side Plank, Bird Dog
- [Progressive Overload](/progressive-overload) is the key to strength, power, speed, endurance, size.
	- Perfect form always, keep it consistent to measure properly.
	- All that matters is that your Reps x Weight goes up
		- e.g. Pullup 10 reps x 0 lbs --> improve reps or weight
		- e.g. Squat 5 reps x 135 lbs --> improve reps or weight

That's it. There's a ton of routines, programs, and all sorts of complications to see if your specific approach is working, but the weight doesn't lie. If your numbers go up across all four key lifts, you're lifting effectively.

My routine is arbitrary:
- 3 x/week for each of Pull/Push/Leg/Core -- could do 1 time, 5 sets for each.
- 3 sets -- could do 1-6 per session
- 8-12 reps -- could do 1-30 for strength, power, speed, 30+ for endurance
- Full-Body -- could do upper-lower, push-pull-legs, bro-split, etc.
