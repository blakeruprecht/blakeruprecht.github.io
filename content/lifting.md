Lifting is fun, primal, joyful movement. You can lift 3 x/week (e.g. MoWeFr) doing a few basic exercises and be strong for life. Focus on [compound lifts](/compound-lifts) over isolation fluff. [Increase weight](/progressive-overload) when you can do 3x12 (track your lifts). Stick with one program and focus on progression, not complexity. Recovery builds muscle, so don't overdo it.

1. Warm up by starting light on your first exercise 
2. 3x8-12 **Legs**: Hinge, Squat, or Split
3. 3x8-12 **Pull**: Pullup/Chinup or Row
4. 3x8-12 **Push**: Dip, Pushup/Bench, or Pike/OHP
5. 3x8-12 **Core**: any variation

- Stretching options to warm-up or add after [running](/running) to cool-down:
	- Chin Tucks -- fix forward head tilt
	- Wall Slides -- loosen up the shoulders (or Band Pull-Apart, Face Pull)
	- Dead Hang -- loosen up the whole spine and shoulders
	- Cobra -- loosen up the lower back and thoracic spine
	- Couch Stretch -- loosen up tight hip flexors from sitting
	- Deep Squat -- open up the hips
	- Glute Bridge -- activate sleeping glutes (or Bird Dog)
