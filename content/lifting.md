Lifting is my main muscle training movement. I focus on progressive overload and fundamental compound lifts. Nothing fancy. Master the basics. Make number go up.

The Fundamental Lifts:
- **Pull** - Pullups, Chinups, Rows, etc
- **Push** - Dips, Pushups, Incline Bench, etc
- **Squat** - Squat, Split Squat, Lunge
- **Hinge** - Deadlift, RDL, Glute Bridge
- **Core** - Plank, Dead Bug, Side Plank, Bird Dog, Carry

The only way to improve at lifting is by progressively overloading the muscles most times you lift to stimulate a growth response. Basically, lift more. Here's how:
- Add weight (same number of reps)
- Add reps (same weight)
- Add speed (increase lift speed or reduce rest between sets)

The program you do doesn't matter. All that matters is whether or not you are adding weights/reps/speed over time. If the numbers are going down, your lifting is a waste of time. Here are some general guidelines:
- *Form*: Perfect form every time, this is non-negotiable. Quality over quantity. Bad form leads to injury, not gains.
- *Frequency*: 1-7 sessions/week (I'm doing 3 full-body)
- *Sets*: 5-20 sets per week (I'm doing 3)
- *Reps*: 1-30 for strength/power/speed, 30+ for endurance (I'm doing 8-12)
- *Recovery*: You can't improve the muscles without recovering. This means:
	- [Sleeping](/sleeping) plenty each night (this is where muscle is built)
	- [Drinking](/drinking) plenty of water each day
	- [Eating](/eating) a surplus of **energy** and **protein**, and plenty of micronutrients
- My current program: 3 x/week full-body:
	1. 3x8-12 Pullups
	2. 3x8-12 Dips or Pushups
	3. 3x8-12 squat or hinge
	4. 3x? core
