Lifting is fun, primal, joyful movement. You can lift 3 x/week (e.g. MoWeFr) doing a few basic exercises and be strong for life. Focus on [compound lifts](/compound-lifts) over isolation fluff. [Increase weight](/progressive-overload) when you can do 3x12 (track your lifts). Stick with one program and focus on progression, not complexity. Recovery builds muscle, so don't overdo it.

1. Warm up by starting light on your first exercise 
2. 3x8-12 **Power**: JumpSquat / HamCurl / 1legBridge
3. 3x8-12 **Pull**: Pullup / Chinup / Row
4. 3x8-12 **Push**: Dip / Pushup / Bench / Pike / OHP / Handstand
5. 3x8-12 **Core**: any variation (deadbug, crawl, abwheel, etc.)
