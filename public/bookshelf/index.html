</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Sun Also Rises - Ernest Hemingway</strong> (fiction) The book where I finally got it. Hemingway takes you on this journey, and at no point tells you what to feel, but gives you all the raw material. What happens in this book? What happens in life, everything and nothing. Definitively, for all time, this book is about the journey, not the destination.</li>
<li><strong>Braiding Sweetgrass - Robin Wall Kimmerer</strong> (nonfiction) A fantastic look at reciprocity from the perspective of a plant scientist, native Potawatomi, and mother. This book almost singularly describes me view of living naturally on this Earth, an absolute tour de force.</li>
<li><strong>Calvin and Hobbes - Bill Watterson</strong> (comic_strip) Watterson transcended the panes of the comic strip and entered rarefied air with the likes of Nobel writers, great scientists, and prophets.</li>
<li><strong>East of Eden - John Steinbeck</strong> (fiction) This took me a year to read, w&gt;</li>
<li><strong>Candide - Voltaire</strong> (fiction) Written in the 18th century, yet made me crack up. Relatable, chaotic, and just plain funny. What a ride, what a book.</li>
<li><strong>The Things They Carried - Tim O&rsquo;Brien</strong> (fiction) This could have been me, bright future, having to go to war, writing about it. Fuck.</li>
<li><strong>Slaughterhouse-Five - Kurt Vonnegut</strong> (fiction) Didn&rsquo;t know what to expect</li>
<li><strong>Siddhartha - Herman Hesse</strong> (fiction) Made me realize what ohm was.</li>
<li><strong>Animal Farm - George Orwell</strong> (fiction) On the Rushmore of political commentary novels. Political satire done right, allegory of a farm is simple and perfect. Snowball and Napoleon are iconic swines.</li>
<li><strong>The Righetous Mind - Jonathan Haidt</strong> (nonfiction) The book I wish I wrote, the science I wish I could do, Haidt introduces the elephant and rider concept, which explains who we really are &ndash; not the conscious mind explaining the action, but the unconscious elephant actually driving all of the action.</li>
<li><strong>The Tao of Pooh - Benjamin Hoff</strong>: This book teaches essential concepts of Taoism thru the lens of my first fictional teacher, Pooh Bear.</li>
<li><strong>Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior - Dan Millman</strong> (fiction) Somehow this man manages to summarize most of the core concepts of Taoism and Zen Buddhism, while ignoring some of the cultural and traditional aspects of those disciplines.</li>
<li><strong>Maus - Art Spiegelman</strong> (graphic novel) Amazing visual description of the Holocaust and the complexities surrounding the perpetrators and the victims.</li>
<li><strong>The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus</strong> (fiction) <em>not done yet</em></li>
<li><strong>The Cartoon History of the Universe, Vol. 1 - Larry Gonick</strong> (nonfiction) The comprehensive history book I would recommend to everyone I know, and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt that the cartoons are fire.</li>
<li><strong>Dances With Wolves - Michael Blake</strong> (fiction) I watched the movie first, then read the book, but either way, I adore it. Is it real? Is it accurate? Who knows. For young Blake, this book was one of my first introductions to the &ldquo;hippy&rdquo; lifestyle &ndash; living off the land, dancing with your community, and cooperating rather than competing. Utopia, anyone?</li>
<li><strong>The Chronicles of Narnia - C.S. Lewis</strong> (fiction series) The first book series I ever read. My parents took me seven times to the local bookstore, and each time I bought the next book in the series with my chore money. I&rsquo;ll never forget the way these books smelled, and the unreal excitement I had getting each next book, slowly building my beautiful collection of tiny paperback books. I loved the covers, I loved the colors, the little drawings randomly spaced out in the book, and above all, Lewis&rsquo; storytelling. Magical.</li>
<li><strong>The Lorax - Dr. Seuss</strong> (fiction) Who is going to speak for the trees? An enduring work that reminds us of one of the essential problems of our time &ndash; protecting the wild places.</li>
<li><strong>Brave New World - Alduous Huxley</strong> (fiction) On the Rushmore of political commentary novels. Introduces the idea of Soma, voluntary class control, and shows how people will delude themselves into believing their happy to go along with the crowd, among many lessons to be learned. Just like the modern day USA, baby!</li>
<li><strong>Mort - Terry Pratchett</strong> (fiction) One of the funniest books I&rsquo;ve ever read, plus a wonderful story. The concept of death as a character will forever be endearing to me. I love thinking about the relationship the living have to death and time, and Pratchett makes me laugh while doing so.</li>
<li><strong>For Whom the Bell Tolls - Ernest Hemingway</strong> (fiction) Part of Hemingway&rsquo;s mystique is his time as a journalist in Europe during the Spanish Civil War. Man, what a time to be alive, and and what a damn good book to represent it. I&rsquo;ll never forget the chance the world had to setup an anarachist/socialist state, but instead, it went fascist. Damn.</li>
<li><strong>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest - Ken Kesey</strong> (fiction) I knew what was coming the entire book, yet it still managed to be triumphant. In the face of death, standing tall and living life your way still has tremendous value. McMurphy is one of the most inspiring fictional characters of all time.</li>
<li><strong>The Right Stuff - Tom Wolfe</strong> (nonfiction) About the pilots who go on to become the Mercury astronauts. A fascinating look at what it takes to win, as well as wonderful descriptions of the cowboy lifestyle. Low-rent, drinking and driving, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Sherlock Holmes - Arthur Conan Doyle</strong> (fiction series) Some of my all time favorite fiction, Sherlock is such a great character, Watson too. I feel like a coked up Sherlock when not working.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams</strong> (fiction) One of the first books that had me cackling out loud during class when I was supposed to be &ldquo;working&rdquo;. Adams is timelessly funny, and left me feeling like life was one big silly crazy play, and I just get to go along for the ride.</li>
<li><strong>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn - Mark Twain</strong> (fiction) This book almost singlehandedly makes me proud to be a Missourian. There are float trips, tomfoolery, and hijinks abound in this book, and it makes some serious social commentary. Twain was far from the war-mongering average american of his day.</li>
<li><strong>The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien</strong> (fiction) I adore the journey of long, epic book series. This one is enduringly popular for good reason. Well written, fascinating, and detailed, this series gets a hold of you and never lets go.</li>
<li><strong>1984 - George Orwell</strong> (fiction) On the Rushmore of political commentary novels. Introduces the idea of double-speak, and details some of the methods fascist/authoritarian regimes use to keep the population in control. Very similar to the Third Reich (Nazis), the USSR (Soviets), and modern-day China (Communists). Chilling.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesdays with Morrie - Mitch Albom</strong> (memoir) A sweet recollection of a students final meetings with his old teacher. Some questions of what could have been linger throughout this book, since the writer hasn&rsquo;t followed the teachers advice closely. A reminder that all we really need is community, relationship, and work to serve those we love.</li>
<li><strong>A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara</strong> (fiction) It&rsquo;s difficult to write about trauma and not profit from it. Look at the success of murder podcasts and news shoes. Nevertheless, this book is a trip. 700+ pages of gripping writing, Yanagihara pens a masterpiece that had me crying, laughing, disgusted, and broken by the end. I had never read a book like this before, and am worried that I&rsquo;ll never find one like this again.</li>
<li><strong>The Old Man and the Sea - Ernest Hemingway</strong> (fiction) The first book I read by Ernest, it opened my eyes to a whole new way of writing and telling stories. About a hundred pages, Hemingway weaves an epic tale of a great battle. I loved it, the simplicity, and the profound wisdom held within the pages.</li>
<li><strong>On the Road - Jack Keruoac</strong> (fiction) Inspired me to take road trips, and it worked.</li>
<li><strong>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter S Thompson</strong> (fiction) &ldquo;We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave&hellip;&rdquo; The forces of old and evil eventually win, and Thompson shows us why. Doing all of those drugs doesn&rsquo;t count as work, I guess.</li>
<li><strong>The Happiness Hypothesis - Jonathan Haidt</strong> (nonfiction) Happiness equals our biologic Setpoint (S) plus the current Conditions (C) of our life, plus our Voluntary (V) actions. H = S + C + V. We can only change S using medication, cognitive-behavior therapy, or meditation. Helpful to know. We can only change C using a lot of time/money/effort, like moving houses, fixing broken cars. V is stuff we can do right here, right now, and the two best things humans can do is focus on loving relationships and flow. Great summary of how to build happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Romeo and Juliet - William Shakespeare</strong> (play) Shakespeare is amazing, and I love this comedy about two young idiots in love. I especially love the &ldquo;Romeo + Juliet&rdquo; movie retelling set in early 2000s Florida, nothing feels more appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Ownership: How US Navy SEALs Lead and Win - Jocko Willink</strong> (memoir) Jocko knows how to win. If you&rsquo;ve ever been a winner at anything, you will recognize the timeless advice Willink compiles (with Babin) in this book. Some of the best leadership advice I&rsquo;ve ever heard, and a great description of what it means to take responsibility for one&rsquo;s own life. Marcus Aurelius updated for the 21st century.</li>
<li><strong>The Fall - Albert Camus</strong> (fiction) My favorite Camus book so far, a fascinating look at a man as he descends into entropy while recounting stories at a dusky bar.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance - Steven Pressfield</strong> (nonfiction) Pressfield puts words to the feelings every creative knows about. The soul crushing procrastination that is the result of resistance. The war of art is finding the ability to turn pro and actually do the work, like someone who does it for money, day in and day out.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers for Algernon - Daniel Keyes</strong> (fiction) A heart-wrenching story, I won&rsquo;t spoil it for you, but let&rsquo;s just say this one made me feel all sorts of ways. Tragic, depressing, uplifting, I dunno man, it&rsquo;s a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Walden - Henry David Thoreau</strong> (nonfiction) In the 1840s some white dude&gt;</li>
<li><strong>The Stranger - Albert Camus</strong> (fiction) Mersault is depressed, or messed up in some other way. I get it, I feel it, this is nihilism taken to the extreme, and Camus shoves it down your throat. I love Camus as a philosopher, and this book did something, but it wasn&rsquo;t everything.</li>
<li><strong>The Way Home: Tales from a life without technology - Mark Boyle</strong> (memoir) Boyle writes a fascinating account of his life giving up money, giving up modern society, and ultimately, giving up some of what makes him happy. A tragic book told like a heroic journey, this book showed me the folly of chasing what I think is right with no compromise. While I agree with his lifestyle, I can&rsquo;t give up my tribe. What to do?</li>
<li><strong>Stuck - Oliver Jeffers</strong> (fiction) A children&rsquo;s book that cracked me up so hard I cried. Everyone should read this, this should be on everyone&rsquo;s bookshelf it&rsquo;s that good.</li>
<li><strong>The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho</strong> (fiction) One of the best allegories for life being one big journey. Such a beautiful journey and reminder about what life is all about, and it&rsquo;s not the destination.</li>
<li><strong>Walden on Wheels - Ken Ilgunas</strong> (nonfiction) More relevant than the original, Ilgunas takes us through his story of living cheaply to pay off debt and get educated in the modern world, illustrating what its like to live against the grain in the modern day.</li>
<li><strong>One World Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism - William Greider</strong> (nonfiction) A book to set the stage for the modern world, explaining the craziness of this little experiment called globalization. The capitalist machine will eat us all!</li>
<li><strong>Things Fall Apart - Chinua Achebe</strong> (fiction) I think about this book, the title, and the overall vibe often. Not sure why, it just seems serenely sad.</li>
<li><strong>So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You - Cal Newport</strong> (nonfiction) Among other books like <em>Deep Work</em>, Newport gives some of the best modern advice about getting a career, namely, that it requires a lot of work no matter which way you slice it.</li>
<li><strong>Fahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury</strong> (fiction) On the Rushmore of political commentary novels. Discusses book burnings, and general apathy towards knowledge and oppressive governments.</li>
<li><strong>Outliers: The Story of Success - Malcolm Gladwell</strong> (nonfiction) The book that revolutionized the idea of long-form journalism to me. Gladwell isn&rsquo;t a scientist (it shows), but he&rsquo;s more than a journalist. Take what he says with a grain of salt, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to go along for the ride &ndash; it&rsquo;s well worth it.</li>
<li><strong>Your Cabin in the Woods - Conrad Meinecke</strong> (nonfiction) A book about building a cabin in the woods from logs. I don&rsquo;t know what else you need, but the drawings are superb.</li>
<li><strong>On the Road - Jack Keruoac</strong> (fiction) Introduced me to unconventional writing styles, great book.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar The Last Airbender - Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko</strong> (TV series) The best tv program ever, four perfect seasons, full of lessons, most of them coming from Uncle Iroh. For him alon, this is a top piece of media ever.</li>
<li><strong>Spongebob Squarepants - Stephen Hillenburg</strong> (TV series) The animation alone is hilarious. Some of the most classic jokes every written. Spongebob single-handedly defined my generation&rsquo;s humor in the sense that I&rsquo;ve asked people if they&rsquo;ve watched it, and the answer defines whether they are funny or not. It&rsquo;s that important.</li>
<li><strong>Californication - Tom Kapinos</strong> (TV series) Hank Moody became my idol. Not because of his womanizing, but the words. The voiceovers, the fighting spirit, the virility of the show as a whole. This man doesn&rsquo;t live placidly, he lives powerfully.</li>
<li><strong>The Big Lebowski - Coen brothers</strong> (film) Dudeism has got to be one of the most relaxing philosophies ever espoused. Great movie, great ideas, let&rsquo;s just chill and go bowling.</li>
<li><strong>V for Vendetta - James McTeigue</strong> (film) A revolutionary film that taught me about rebellion and what it means to live based on your own code. V fights for what is right, and his eloquent sobriquets leave me loving words even more.</li>
<li><strong>Back in Black - AC/DC</strong> (album) Bon Scott dies in 1980, six months later the rest of acka dacka come out with the ultimate homage to the rock lifestyle - sex, drugs, and alcohol.</li>
<li><strong>Captain Fantastic - Matt Ross</strong> (film) Shows the lifestyle I dream of living with my family, both the extreme version, and then the toned back version. Absolutely fantastic depiciton of modern left-wing anarchists.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore History - Dan Carlin</strong> (podcast) Carlin expands what podcasts can do with well-researched, multi-hour epics on topics like the First World War, Japan before WWII, and Painfotainment, the history of using human pain as entertainment. My only gripe is that my drives aren&rsquo;t long enough to finish entire series in one trip.</li>
