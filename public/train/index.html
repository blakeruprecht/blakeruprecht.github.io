        <h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>
<p>The first key to training has nothing to do with training itself. It&rsquo;s everything you do outside of training. Training, exercise, whatever you call it, is inherently stressful. You&rsquo;re basically tearing down your body to rebuild it stronger. The key point there is &ldquo;rebuild.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Caloric surplus/deficit determines weight gain/loss, not exercise</li>
<li>Sleep builds muscle, exercise provides the stress to signal the body to build</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have the best training program in the world, if you&rsquo;re not eating enough calories and protein, not drinking enough water, or not getting enough sleep, you won&rsquo;t make progress. Consistency and recovery are what matter. You can train for 15 mins per day and get fit as hell if you are consistent and recover well. You can train for 1 hour per day and lose muscle if you aren&rsquo;t eating enough food and sleeping enough.</p>
<h2 id="consistency--recovery--all-else">Consistency + Recovery &gt; All Else</h2>
<p>Anything is better than nothing. So much information out there today is obsessed with optimal. Optimal routines, optimal splits, optimal exercises. You can always optimize. But the key to training is consistency, not optimal. Doing something is infinitely better than doing nothing. Keep training simple so that you&rsquo;ll do the one thing that matters &ndash; train.</p>
<p>All training typically falls into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardio: train the ability of the heart and lungs to deliver energy to the muscles
<ul>
<li>Anaerobic: deliver glycogen during high-intensity movements</li>
<li>Aerobic: deliver oxygen to the muscles during most exercise</li>
<li>Long-duration: do aerobic exercise for a long time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resistance: train the muscles (form, strength, speed, power, endurance, size)
<ul>
<li>Form/Technique: the most important thing to train to prevent injury</li>
<li>Strength/Speed/Power/Endurance: the function of the muscles is to move the bones of the body through space</li>
<li>Size: for show (a result of getting stronger/more enduring)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All exercises hit both, but to varying degrees. Power lifting focuses on resistance to build strength, and hard sets build anaerobic cardio as well. Sprinting builds anaerobic cardio, and some muscle as well. Pushups build muscle, and sometimes muscular and anaerobic endurance. Jogging builds aerobic endurance.</p>
<h2 id="simple-cardio-training">Simple Cardio Training:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run two miles, 3x per week. Run at a slow pace where you can breathe using only your nose. If you&rsquo;re feeling really good, run faster if you want. Or don&rsquo;t. Add in a sprint or two at the end for an awesome boost.</li>
<li>Skip Rope for 10 minutes, try to hit 1000 jumps in that time. Or practice skills like different jumping patterns and double-unders.</li>
<li>Walk as much as you can everyday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that gets the heart rate up counts as cardio training. Sprinting, jumping, rowing, bicycling, running, hiking. Hell, walking is one of the best forms of cardio ever invented, it&rsquo;s low impact, it&rsquo;s easy. Whatever you do, just make sure you&rsquo;re doing something.</p>
<p>Somebody who runs three times per week is going to have great aerobic fitness after a year. Somebody who skips for 10 minutes and continually improves will be way better off than somebody who did a marathon once five years ago.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t over-complicate it. If you want to start running, I recommend starting with working up to a 30 minute walk. Then start running with a 1 minute run. If that works, do 2 minutes the next day or after a rest day. Then 3 minutes&hellip; and slowly build up. Stop if you feel soreness in your shins (shin splints are an overuse injury and can only be fixed by resting). Go easy, work up slowly, and before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be running for 30 minutes straight. Once you hit this mark, you can reduce the time and just focus on increasing speed, like my two mile running idea above.</p>
<h2 id="simple-resistance-training">Simple Resistance Training:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Train bodyweight calisthenics daily. Do one movement from each category.
<ul>
<li>Push: Pushups, Dips, Pike Pushups</li>
<li>Pull: Pullups, Chinups, Inverted Rows</li>
<li>Legs: Squat, Lunge, Glute Bridge, One Leg RDL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or lift full-body 3x per week. Pick a Push, a Pull, and a Legs movement each time. Take a rest day between each lift.
<ul>
<li>Push: Bench Press, Incline Bench Press, Overhead Press</li>
<li>Pull: Pullups, Lat Pull-downs, Rows</li>
<li>Legs: Squat, RDL, Split Squat, Hamstring Curl, etc (Note: conventional deadlifts basically count as a pull and legs movement)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do three sets per exercise. Go as hard as you can, and take it easy whenever you&rsquo;re tired, underfed, or not feeling well. Take rest days if you&rsquo;re sick. Rep ranges don&rsquo;t really matter, anywhere from 1-30 reps will build muscle and power and size, given the set is taken close to muscular failure (not form failure, that&rsquo;s bad to do 100% of the time).</p>
<p>Focus on nailing the form. Slowly add reps/weight over time. One consistent set of pushups per day, performed to close-to-failure, will be infinitely more beneficial than sporadically benching every couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What about other exercises, isolation movements, etc? Sure, knock yourself out, but all those extras are for people that consistently hammer the basics: who train Push, Pull, and Legs, get plenty of sleep, eat super well, and have the free time and interest to do more exercises. For most people, they&rsquo;re just not helpful, let alone necessary.</p>
