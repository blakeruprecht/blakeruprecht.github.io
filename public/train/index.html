        <p>Anything is better than nothing.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to do something, the simplest approach is to pick one form of muscular exercise and one form of cardio exercise to improve all nine physical adaptations the body can make to exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Muscle Technique</em> - basically, are your bones being moved through space by the correct muscles.</li>
<li><em>Muscle Endurance</em> - how many reps of a movement you can do.</li>
<li><em>Muscle Strength</em> - how much force the muscles can produce, aka how much tension they can resist.</li>
<li><em>Muscle Speed</em> - how fast the muscles can contract.</li>
<li><em>Muscle Power</em> - strength times speed, usually relative to your body weight (e.g. max vertical jump).</li>
<li><em>Muscle Size</em> - how big the muscles are. Aka hypertrophy, usually bigger muscles enable more strength, power, endurance.</li>
<li><em>Cardio Anaerobic Endurance</em> - how well your body uses glycogen for short, powerful, and intense movements (like sprinting, jumping)</li>
<li><em>Cardio Aerobic Endurance</em> - how well your body uses oxygen for energy</li>
<li><em>Cardio Long-duration Endurance</em> - how long you can sustain any activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the adaptations, there are practically infinite ways to make those adaptations happen: manual labor, calisthenics, barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, sandbags, sprinting, jumping, chopping wood, running, skipping rope, bicycling, rowing.</p>
<p>All of those modalities address some slice of the above adaptations. Running can help with all of the cardio stuff (it includes sprinting), which helps out some muscles, but it will never fix your posture or improve your chest strength. Similarly, the Pushup is a powerful way to build upper body pushing strength and core stability, as well as endurance and cardio anaerobic strength if done intensely, but pushups will never improve your leg strength or aerobic endurance.</p>
<p>For most people, the best bet is to pick one form of cardio training and one form of muscular training that you like, and just do them. Practice them, over and over, until you get the form down. Then, keep practicing them for the rest of your life. Switch out exercises when you get bored, stick with what you love, but just keep doing it.</p>
<h2 id="muscle-training">Muscle Training</h2>
<p>Technique is the most important part of muscular training, so focus on technique (perfect form) more than any other aspect. Muscular training can be as simple as picking one major exercise from each of the following categories, and performing three sets of that exercise three times per week.</p>
<p>The most important part of muscular training, whether you do calisthenics, barbells, dumbbells, machines, or anything else, is doing each movement with proper form. There are many forms of each fundamental movement. For example, the squat can be done with just body weight, dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, sandbags, etc, but the fundamental movement of standing upright, squatting down, and standing back up applies across all resistance types.</p>
<p>The Big 4</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squat</strong>: Air Squat, Barbell Squat, Lunge, Split Squat
<ul>
<li>Muscles worked: Quadriceps, Glutes, Adductors, Calves, Core</li>
<li>The most fundamental exercise for humans, can be split into dual leg (squat) or single leg (split squat, lunge).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hinge</strong>: Glute Bridge, RDL, Deadlift
<ul>
<li>Muscles worked: Hamstrings, Glutes, Lower Back, Forearms</li>
<li>Deadlifts are very hard, glute bridges are pretty easy. Most people need something to specifically target their hamstrings, glutes, and lower back (the main part of the posterior chain) to help counteract sitting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong>: Pushup, Dip, Pike Pushup, Bench Press, Overhead Press
<ul>
<li>Muscles worked: Chest, Front Delts, Triceps</li>
<li>Can be split into horizontal (pushup, bench, dip) which hits the chest more, and vertical (pike, OHP) which hits the shoulders more.</li>
<li>Dumbbells or ring variations effectively isolates the left and right sides of the chest/shoulders/triceps effectively.</li>
<li>Isolation movements like chest flys, skullcrushers, etc, can be thrown in to target weak points, but aren&rsquo;t necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pull</strong>: Pullup, Chinup, Row, Lat Pulldown
<ul>
<li>Muscles worked: Lats, Traps, Rear Delts, Biceps</li>
<li>Can be split into vertical (pullup, lat pulldown) which hits the lats more, and horizontal (rows) which hit the traps more.</li>
<li>Dumbbells or ring variations effectively isolates the left and right sides of the torso/arms effectively.</li>
<li>Isolation movements like bicep curls can be thrown in to target weak points, but again, not necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Program</strong>: There are millions of programs out there, but the basic rule of thumb is this: 5 sets per week of each of the above categories to maintain the muscles within each category. E.g. 5 sets per week of high-effort pushups will maintain the chest, 6 weeks will grow the chest.</p>
<p>In general, more reps and lighter weights build more muscular size and endurance, lower reps and heavier weights build more strength, power comes down to performing reps quickly/explosively. Typically, 1-5 reps are recommended for power work, 4-12 for strength work, 8-30 for size, and 30+ for endurance, but in reality, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What matters more is that you take the movements to mechanical failure &ndash; push as hard as you can, but stop once your form suffers (never do an exercise with improper form!).</p>
<h2 id="cardio">Cardio</h2>
<p>Anaerobic: sprinting, max jumps, high-intensity interval training for intervals sub-60 seconds or so. This is badass stuff, feels amazing, is mentally challenging, and improves the muscles too. Hell, just sprinting alone could probably help you make massive muscular and cardio gains at the same time. I think it&rsquo;s great to get your heart rate up close to your max at least once per week (consult your doctor or whatever to make sure you&rsquo;re healthy enough to do this).</p>
<p>Aerobic &amp; Long-duration: The meat and potatoes of cardio training, this is what most people think of when they think of cardio &ndash; steady-state runs, long bike rides, long hikes, etc. There&rsquo;s really no upper limit to how much of this you can do and still benefit from each week (something like 180 mins is optimal for growth). I don&rsquo;t care for optimal, so I run three times per week, two miles at a time, and just try to run fast when I feel good, and take it easy when I feel bad. My times are going up.</p>
<h2 id="routines">Routines</h2>
<p>As per usual, keep it simple stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to warm-up before any training session. I do this with yoga, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Neck: Chin Tucks 10x Chin Tucks or Neck Rolls (both sides)</li>
<li>Upper Spine: 10x Wall Slides</li>
<li>Thoracic Spine: 10x Cat-cow or Downward Dog to Cobra</li>
<li>Hip Flexors: 30 sec Couch Stretch (per side)</li>
<li>Glutes: 10x Glute Bridges</li>
<li>Lower Body: 60 sec Deep Squat</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to train daily, but I try to keep it pretty simple. I&rsquo;ll train my muscles with either:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 sets of Pushups (and variations) super-setted with 3 sets of Pullups (any variation). Followed up with Air Squats or Glute Bridges, if I&rsquo;m not lifting that week (I usually am, so I skip the body weight leg training).</li>
<li>OR Lifting, alternating between different splits, e.g. my favorite is 3x per week, either full-body or alternating upper/lower or some other split
<ul>
<li>Full-Body: first a heavy Leg Lift (Squat/Hinge), then a Push, then a Pull. Skip the pull if you deadlift first (that hits pull pretty hard too).</li>
<li>Upper: super-set Pushes and Pulls until I get tired, finish with arms.</li>
<li>Lower: start with a heavy Squat/Hinge, then do a lighter version of whatever I didn&rsquo;t do first, e.g. Back Squat and Hamstring Curls, or RDL and Lunges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll train my cardio with either</p>
<ul>
<li>Running - I stick with two miles runs, and go as fast as I feel like. I&rsquo;ll sprint at the end if I&rsquo;m feeling juicy, and maybe get a few more sprints in, but maybe not.</li>
<li>Skip Rope - doing 1000 skips in 10 minutes is a great, fast cardio workout. Sometimes I go for double-unders and other tricks, and that intensity is crazy good.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consistency-over-perfection">Consistency over Perfection</h2>
<p>Honestly, training is not that complicated. Doing something, anything, is really good for the body and mind. I love the mental clarity I get from exercise, and I genuinely enjoy it. After 10 years of training, I have realized that exercise is more about just getting out there and enjoying my body rather than chasing any numbers. Who cares what you lift, how fast you run, any of that shit. All that matters is getting out there, taking care of your body, and enjoying yourself while doing it.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, I&rsquo;ve honestly probably averaged about 1 lift and 1 run per week. I&rsquo;ve taken weeks off at a time from both. Sometimes, I&rsquo;ll hit my entire routine in a week. Most weeks, I only do a portion of what I wrote &ndash; maybe two sets of pushups and pullups, one run, and a lower body lift. Some weeks it&rsquo;ll look like all runs, no lifting. It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ve learned that perfection doesn&rsquo;t matter, just consistency. If you&rsquo;re not having fun with a program, or an exercise, just skip it, move on to something you do like. There are a million ways to skin this cat.</p>
<p>The reality is, most of us don&rsquo;t need to be competitive weightlifters, pro runners, or really even good at any of this physical stuff. Most of us rely on our minds and voice more than our bodies to succeed in life, so this physical training stuff can just be a relaxing, enjoyable way to take care of our bodies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep running, doing pushups and pullups, stretching out my muscles, and lifting. I&rsquo;m going to do these things for the rest of my life. I don&rsquo;t care what my numbers are, I don&rsquo;t care what yours are, I just care that my body feels good. And it does, so I&rsquo;ll keep the train rolling, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
