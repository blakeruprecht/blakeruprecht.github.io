I know what is right and wrong, and I know what a good future looks like -- and I will pursue it regardless of what others say.\n\n- **Loving presence**. This moment is enough. I slash my thoughts, letting go of fear and shame, and embrace this moment wholeheartedly. I don't need to prove myself to anyone -- I'm already radiant. I'll keep moving towards what makes me feel alive, energized, and loving.\n\n- **I lead the way**. I have the courage to walk my path, step by step, pursuing my own vision, and never submitting to what others believe is best. I don't need permission, I trust myself to lead.\n\n- **Natural simplicity**. I trust the process, and know that my present actions will take me towards my future vision. I keep it simple, clear, intentional, and beautiful.\n","x":-20,"y":829,"width":720,"height":504},

It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor, and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of oyour mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life; just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, you are already free!\"\n> -Dan Millman, *The Way of the Peaceful Warrior*","x":700,"y":1169,"width":720,"height":982},
