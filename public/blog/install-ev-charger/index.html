<h1>Do it yourself EV charger installation</h1>

<p>Charging your car at your own home is just plain convenient. You won&rsquo;t have to go find a charger that may be blocked by other cars, or is out of your way. Of course, you can plug your car into the standard 120 Volt outlet common around most houses and businesses, but installing a 240 Volt fast charger could have your charging time at home. When a typical full charge takes 10 hours on 120 V, cutting that down to 5 hours means the difference between a full or partial charge at night.</p>
<h2 id="120-volts-versus-240-volts">120 Volts versus 240 Volts</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, all of the electricity coming into residential houses in the United States has an electric potential of 240 V. Some large electric appliances in the home like dryers, ranges, and water heaters run off 240 V, whereas all of the other electric appliances in the home run off 120 V, like refrigerators, toasters, light bulbs, and televisions. You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the 120 V outlet, shown on the (right) in the image below. If you&rsquo;ve ever seen the two outlets on the left, those are the new four-prong 240 V (left) and old three-prong 240 V (middle) outlets common in houses all over the US.</p>
<p><img src="/wall-outlets-USA.png" alt="Example of four-prong 240V, three-prong 240V, and 120V USA outlets"></p>
<h2 id="electrical-load-capacity">Electrical Load Capacity</h2>
<p>Electricity comes into a house from the main power lines at 240 V. When we talk about electricity, it&rsquo;s important to remember that electricity is measured in two main ways: voltage and current, which when multiplied together, give you the total power output of the electricity.
In math terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAMES: Power = Current x Voltage</li>
<li>UNITS: Watts = Amps x Volts</li>
</ul>
<p>So all electricity comes into a house at 240 Volts. What&rsquo;s the current? Well, it depends. When the electrical company &ldquo;hooks up&rdquo; a new house with power, they install a certain size of external electrical box to accomodate the power the home builders calculate will be used. From this exterior box, wires are run to the interior electrical box, which disseminates electricity to all of the other wires in the house. Based on the power consumption calculated for that specific house, the electric company will install an exterior box that can handle a certain current load, since the voltage is fixed at 240 V. Typically, 100 Amps, 150 Amps, or 200 Amps. Some older houses have 60 Amp boxes. These boxes determine the total power consumption the house can use at any given moment. For example, a house with a 100 Amp box receiving 240 Volts of electricity can use a maximum of (100 A)(240 V) = 24000 Watts (24 kilowatts) of power at any given moment.</p>
<p>Even if a house has 100 Amp capacity, it&rsquo;s still likely the the interior electrical box has hookups for more than 100 Amps of electrical connection. For example, a fuse box may have room for 200 Amps of connection. The assumption here is that not every electrical appliance will be turned on at the same time. If they are, the breaker will flip, shutting off electricity to the appliances so that the house doesn&rsquo;t catch on fire.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-load-capacity">Calculating Load Capacity</h2>
<p>Regardless of what load capacity your home already has, adding an EV charger will increase your total power consumption significantly. It&rsquo;s like adding another electric dryer to your house, a typical Level 2 (the industry term for 240 Volt chargers) charger uses 7200 Watts, or 7.2 kW, of electricity during charging. You can see how a house with a 24 kW limit from a 100 Amp external box would see a significant increase in electrical load during car charging time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the tricky part of calculating load capacity &ndash; it changes depending on what specific electrical appliances you own and operate. Some electric dryers use more power than others, same with hairdryers, vaccuums, phone chargers, ranges, and light bulbs. Typically, individual breakers in the interior electrical box will be rated for 20 Amps with the voltage stepped down to 120 Volts, for a total power capacity of 2400 Watts.</p>
<p>To calculate your home capacity, I recommend using an online calculator that makes certain assumptions about power usage. I would check a few different ones to verify that your numbers are coming out similarly when using different formulas. After this step, you can decide whether your current box is good, or if you need to call your electric company to increase your service amperage.</p>

<p>Depending on where you have chosen to install your charger, you may need to build some posts to hold it off the ground, or mount it to the wall.</p>
<p>Connect to the app. This is the easy part, read the instructions the charger came with to connect the app to your home wifi, and you&rsquo;re good to go!</p>
