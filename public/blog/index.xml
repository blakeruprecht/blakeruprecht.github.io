      <description>Building a computer is a fun journey, especially with the plethora of YouTube tutorials at your fingertips, but the real challenge lies in ensuring your chosen components are compatible. Get this wrong and you may end up with a black screen or, worse, fried components. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know about compatibility to avoid disaster.
Motherboard and CPU. Your motherboard is the cornerstone of your build. Think of it as the backbone that connects and supports all other components.</description>

      <description>For the record, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend you install an EV charger yourself if you have no electrical experience. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely dangerous, and if you mess up, you can very easily catch your house on fire, or worse. However, it&amp;rsquo;s cool to at least now the process in theory, and this way, you can see if your electrician is doing it properly as well.
How much does it cost? If it was free, everyone would do it.</description>

      <description>I ate a scorpion in Bangkok and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good. The outer shell dominated the texture, and the meat tasted vaguely stale. Would not recommend.
I also ate grasshoppers, crickets, mealworms, and bamboo worms. I liked them all, and liked the mealworms so much I bought them many more times for a crunchy snack. They reminded me of a meatier cheese puff &amp;ndash; salty, crunchy, and airy. The crickets had much more substance to them, but were suprisingly good, with a roasted, fishy flavor.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done 5 years of science research and development using mainly Python, and have used the major scientific computing libraries. While this topic may seem intimidating, the actual usage of each library is typically pretty brief (a few lines of code), so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert in each library, you just need to generally know what they do so you can use them when you need to. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview with some of the most common code explained.</description>

      <description>Python is the most useful general purpose programming language, probably because it is easy to use. Don&amp;rsquo;t let that fool you, it&amp;rsquo;s still difficult to get this anaconda up and running on your own computer.
Installation instructions Here&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll typically see, as concisely as possible. Bold terms are explained in the FAQ.
Download the latest version of Python from the official website for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY
Note: I use {curly brackets} to represent variables where you replace the text inside the brackets, and don&amp;rsquo;t type the brackets themselves. This is often used in documentation, but not explained, so be on the lookout. Note: I use code text to represent code that should be typed into the terminal command line. ls lists files; ls -la lists all files the long way cd changes directory, cd .. goes up one dir, cd {dir} takes you to the &amp;ldquo;dir&amp;rdquo; folder mv {dir1/old} {dir2/new} moves a file from the first dir position to the second dir position mv {dir1} {dir2} changes the name of the folder mkdir {dirname} creates a new directory touch {filename} creates a new empty file grep [options] pattern {files} searchs all the files in {files} for the &amp;ldquo;pattern&amp;rdquo; specified, e.</description>

      <description>I recently posted about my Linux setup, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a shocking realization &amp;ndash; any OS is fine. Strengths and drawbacks, right?
Linux: Cost: FREE Ease of use: ADVANCED USERS, MOSTLY Coding: OTIMAL MacOS: Cost: EXPENSIVE (requires an expensive macbook) Ease of use: EASY TO USE Coding: EASY Windows: Cost: EXPENSIVE (requires a $100 license) Ease of use: FINE Coding: ANNOYING If you already have Windows, my recommendation is to just keep it until you get annoyed enough to need to switch, which could be never.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trained as a computer scientist, so technically I know nothing about computer hardware. That&amp;rsquo;s the domain of computer engineers. Still, I have a lot of experience with computers and can give some general recommendations. This is probably most applicable to people in the USA, but not too sure.
I recommend Apple Macbooks, Dell XPS 13s, and Lenovo Thinkpads in this article. There are many more good computers out there, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have personal experience with others, so I won&amp;rsquo;t recommend them.</description>

      <description>Update 2024-09-27 Of course, I did this as a fun experiment to see if Linux was worth it. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months of daily driving this setup on my computer, and I can confidently say that it works great. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do it again, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll install Linux Mint next, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to MacOS.
I appreciate being able to do this, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I ever personally want to dedicate the time to this much coding again.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Intelligence is the ability to get what you want.&amp;rdquo;
As agents, we set goals and figure out how to achieve them. That&amp;rsquo;s what being smart is. Being intelligent is not the ability to learn 100 digits of Pi. That&amp;rsquo;s just pure computation. Being intelligent is reciting those digits to a girl you have a crush on, but only if it works. If she gets the ick, then that behavior was dumb, unless you were purely competing with yourself, in which case it&amp;rsquo;s back to being smart.</description>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/growth-mindset/</guid>
      <description>Summary: Change your mindset to prioritize growth by praising yourself for effort, hard-work, and learning. Talk to yourself like a friend, don&amp;rsquo;t try to be perfect, and engage in positive self-talk. Eventually, you will be making more progress than you ever were with a fixed mindset.
Growth mindset is when you believe you can improve at anything with time and effort. Instead of seeing challenges as an internal problem, you see them as a chance to get better and improve.</description>

      <description>I normally pay \$5-6 for cold brew out at a coffee shop. That&amp;rsquo;s about \$0.45/oz of coffee! I&amp;rsquo;m all for supporting local business, but I am also a local business and need to support myself, so here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it at home. The secrets won&amp;rsquo;t surprise you!
The Process Gather ingredients and tools. The total cost for the tools should be less than $40. Two big jars and a metal filter.</description>

      <description>At the highest level, machines learn very similarly to how humans learn. Data is given to the neural network, and then the robot does some calculations and tests it&amp;rsquo;s performance against the environment.
Supervised Learning (SL) Data comes with labels. The network makes an initial random guess at what the labels should be. Then, it compares the guesses to the actual labels, and determines how off it was (total error). It updates the network according to this error.</description>

      <description>Utilizes temporal data, aka LSTM units can use previous information in their determination of current state.
The first sigmoid is the &amp;ldquo;forget-gate&amp;rdquo; $f_t$, the second sigmoid is the &amp;ldquo;input-gate&amp;rdquo;, $i_t$, the tanh is the &amp;ldquo;cell-update&amp;rdquo;, $\tilde{C}_t$. Forget-gate will determine how much of the previous cell-state we need to remember, input-gate determines how much of the new cell-state we need to remember, and cell-update gate normalizes the cell-state between [-1,1] because of the tanh.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Neural Network that incorporates Fuzzy Sets The first major project I worked on was coding up the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in Python, specifically utilizing the PyTorch package to calculate the gradients. I calculated the gradients by hand to validate PyTorch, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you know it, PyTorch knows what it&amp;rsquo;s doing.
ANFIS is a type of artificial neural network that combines the antecedent and consequent logic (fuzzy IF-THEN rules) of fuzzy logic with the backpropagation learning techniques of multilayer perceptrons.</description>

      <description>Similar to a Kohonen map, another self-organing map, but this time the topology is learned. Goal is to learn a topological structure to relate &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo; datapoints to each other. Winner-takes-most. Growing neural gas starts with two-neurons and keeps adding a bisecting neuron until the stopping criteria is met (e.g. performance measure below threshold)
Algorithm Given an input dataset $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ Init &amp;ldquo;weights&amp;rdquo; $w_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ Pick a datapoint $v$ from $x$, For each weight $w_i$, calculate the distance to $v$ For each weight, determine the number (cardinality?</description>

      <description>This is a really cool integral that basically maps any metric function on sets like the MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, MEDIAN
Choquet Integral: The Math Where $\pi(j)$ sorts the inputs based on their output values, $h_{\pi(j)}$, which is the output for input $x_j$. Little g is a measure such that $g(A) &amp;lt; g(B)$ if $A \subseteq B$, $g(\emptyset) = 0$, $g(\mathbf{X}) = 1$. ChI adheres to monotonicity, idempotency, subcontinuity, etc. This includes the Linear Order Statistic (LOS) the Order Weighted Average (OWA), Maximum, Minimum, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/multilayer-perceptron/</guid>
      <description>A type of NN that implements multiple layers of the basic perceptron.
$\mathbf{x}$ = input vector (e.g. $\mathbf{x}=[0.3, 5.4, 156.1]$) of length $N$ ($N=3$ in this e.g.), $\mathbf{x} \in [-\infty,\infty]$, can be normalized to [-1,1]$ or $[0,1]$
$\mathbf{w}$ = weight vector of length $N$ in the range $[0,1]$
$\sigma$ = activation function (typically ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, etc.)
$y$ = output scalar
$\hat{y}$ = label scalar
$e$ = error or loss function (typically Mean Squared Error as shown here)</description>

      <title>Neural Networks approximate any function</title>
      <link>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/neural-network/</link>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/neural-network/</guid>
      <description>The Universal Function Approximation theorem states that Neural Networks of increasing size and depth can approximate any function in the world. This is amazing.
NNs start as multilayer perceptrons and add MLPs side-by-side to create layers, and add more layers to create depth.
Activation Functions ReLU TanH Sigmoid Loss Functions $\frac{1}{2}e^2$ Softmax $\sigma(z) = e^{z_i} (\Sigma^K_{j=1}e^{z_j})^{-1}$
$z$ is the input vector, $\in {-\infty,\infty}$, can be pos, neg, zero.
$\exp{z}$ is applied to each element of the input vector, gives a pos.</description>
