<p>Simple living is natural, easy, frugal, spiritual, sustainable, economical, healthy, fun, connected, and anarchist. All of the great teachers of the world have advocated for simple living: Pooh Bear, Hobbes (not Calvin), dogs &amp; cats, Baloo, all trees, Uncle Iroh, Lao Tzu, the Lorax. Simple living is sexy!</p>

<h2 id="references">REFERENCES</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dogs. Look at them. They lick their balls in public. They pee wherever they want. The enjoy the hell out of some loafing and loping. They let their emotions go, not dwelling on the past or future. The philosophy of Cynicism is named after them (Ancient Greek <em>kynikos</em> meant dog).</li>
<li>Lao Tzu. Started a little &ldquo;religion&rdquo; (moreso way of life) called Taoism, but it&rsquo;s not really called the Tao, or is it? Haha who cares, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Look it up if you want, or don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Trees. They stand there so peacefully, and live in harmony with eachother. Did you know trees make friends with eachother?</li>
<li>Wabi-sabi. The Japanese philosophy of accepting transience and imperfection. More!</li>
<li>Hygge. The Danish philosophy of coziness, candles, warm drinks, good books, and better friends. I love it.</li>
<li>Jonathan Haidt. <em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em>. A fantastic book by a researcher of behavioral psychology at UVA, Haidt sums up most of the current research of human happiness with one simple formula.
<ul>
<li>Haidt teaches the formula H = S + C + V. (H)appiness refers to your subjective feeling of well-being. It is dependent on three broad factors.</li>
<li>The (S)etpoints of your brain biochemistry. These are the product of your genetics and lived experiences up until this point. Some people are just naturally happier than others, it&rsquo;s unfair. The only scientifically proven ways to change brain biochem are through meditation (seriously), cognitive-behavioral therapy (other types of therapy aren&rsquo;t as effective), and prescription medication (self-prescribed doesn&rsquo;t count).</li>
<li>The (C)onditions of your life refer to enduring factors like where you live, what career you have, the family and friends around you. These are hard to change, but definitely malleable. The research shows that it&rsquo;s much more important to remove negatives and annoyances from your life than adding positives, due to hedonic adaptation. For example, moving to a city without smog pollution will increase your happiness much more than moving to a warmer city. Making enough money to not worry about paying your bills will make you much more happy than being rich.</li>
<li>The (V)oluntary actions of your day-to-day life are the easiest to change, and thus, the biggest potential area for happiness improvement for most people. Haidt&rsquo;s advice is to stop focusing on pretty much everything except for loving relationships and flow activities. This is obvious to me, when I look into my heart, anything that isn&rsquo;t contributing to flow or love probably isn&rsquo;t worth a single damn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Harvard Study of Adult Development</em> by Harvard Researchers is an 80+ year long study that once again shows that <em>community</em> is what&rsquo;s important in life, not prestige, money, success, or any of that other bullshit. And the most important part of your community is your choice of life partner.</li>
<li>Andrew Huberman. <em>Huberman Lab Podcast</em>. Hubes is a Stanfard researcher of biology, interviews other resesearch scientists and doctors about how to be healthy. If you want to learn more about the importance of sleep and sunlight, daily exercise, proper nutrition, or anything else related to health, check out this podcast. Huberman sums it up as the following, in no particular order:
<ul>
<li>sleep plenty with consistent wakeup time</li>
<li>viewing of morning and evening sunlight</li>
<li>daily exercise/movement</li>
<li>daily drinking of water and eating of proper nutrition</li>
<li>relationships</li>
<li>stress-relief (similar to Haidt&rsquo;s S category)</li>
<li>oral health &amp; gut microbiome</li>
<li>spiritual grounding, purpose, &amp; mission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mitch Albom. <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em>. This book emphasizes the importance of community, love, and serving others through your work above all else. If you&rsquo;re noticing a common theme, it&rsquo;s that stuff and consumption is never included in this discussion, happiness is all about connecting with the people around you and creating stuff that makes you feel flow.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ. Pretty sure that dude advocated for simple living, chosen poverty, giving the shirt off your back to your brother, etc etc.</li>
<li>The Dude. Made famous in <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, the Dude started a cult called &ldquo;Dudeism&rdquo; which is basically a rebranding of Taoism.</li>
