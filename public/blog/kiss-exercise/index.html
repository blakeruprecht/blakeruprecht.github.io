<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kboges">K Boges</a> on Youtube, he explains this exercise theory better than I possibly could. All of his videos are very short, and he gets right to the point each time. A modern day youtube hero.</p>
<h2 id="training-cardio--muscles">Training Cardio &amp; Muscles</h2>
<p>My takeaway from his extensive knowledge is summarized here, I don&rsquo;t want to explain further because I&rsquo;m not an expert, so look to Boges for more info if you are curious.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking is probably the single best thing to do for overall health, especially since it can be done anywhere</li>
<li>Pushups are the single best movement to train the entire upper-body pushing musculature (chest, triceps, front delts).</li>
<li>Pullups are the single best movement to train the entire upper-body pulling musculature (lats, traps, bicpes, rear delts).</li>
<li>Bodyweight exercises are safer, easier on the joints and tendons, and can be trained everyday as a form of physical hygiene. Of course, lifting is wonderful too, and can be incorporated into any strength training routine if you are knowledgeable, but at the very least, calisthenics is a great start, and can take any individual very far.</li>
<li>Similarly, the entire lower body can be trained using bodyweight Squat and Lunge variations, plus Sprinting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="posture-mobility-and-core">Posture, Mobility, and Core</h2>
<p>In addition to training the muscles, many of us suffer from poor mobility due to sedentary/sitting lifestyles, so special focus should be made to improve posture, mobility, and core stiffness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posture starts with proper breathing, so learn to nose-breath slowly and deeply the majority of your day (including sleep and mild cardio).</li>
<li>Mobility of the joints is essential, so mobilize your ankles, knees, hips, core, and shoulders to make sure they can go through all of the proper motions.
<ul>
<li>Stretch the hip-flexors using couch stretch, stretch the hamstrings using elephant stretch, stretch the inner leg muscles, stretch the lower-back using cat-camel &amp; snake pose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strengthen core stiffness using the McGill big 3: Curl ups, Bird dogs, and Side planks.</li>
<li>Strengthen the glutes using glute bridges and deep squat holds.</li>
</ul>
