<h1>Set grocery shopping PRs</h1>

<span>
	
</span>

<p>I went grocery shopping with my buddy recently and was totally baffled when we did the unthinkable: we <em>backtracked</em>. We went back to the produce section not once, but twice, making three total trips through the same section. Grocery shopping is my least favorite part of the eating experience, yet it seems to be a necessity for most people. My garden is non-existent, and my foraging skills are abysmal, so the next best option is to take my hard-earned cash into the big unwindowed box of fluorescent lighting and try to navigate the dense forest of packaged items. I hate it, so I’ve devised a strategy to get me in and out of the grocery store as fast as possible. My record for a typical run (I tend to do 1 or 2 per week depending on how well I can meal plan) is 30 minutes on the dot from front door to front door (including 10 minutes of driving time). Yes, I time it to motivate me to go. Speed is the name of the game. Here’s my strategy.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-pick-a-grocery-store">Step 1: Pick a grocery store</h2>
<p>Often, the best grocery store is the one closest to your house. Luckily for me, the closest one was also a relatively small one-off store that offered mostly whole foods and organic-type foods (like the old Luckys Market in middle America). Think &ldquo;Whole Foods&rdquo;, but smaller and cheaper. I also shopped at the local Hy-Vee big chain stor (like a Kroger/Gerbes) on occasion, but it was bigger, and full of all of the bullshit mystery aisles that carry mostly unhealthy food. I have a theory about grocery stores. Ignoring the non-food items that grocery stores carry, every grocery store carries the same stuff. There&rsquo;s always a produce section carrying fruits and vegetables, typically located close to the entrance. Most grocery stores place their deli, meat, dairy, and frozen along the back wall. Sometimes frozen is in the aisles of mystery.</p>
<p>Everything else is in the aisles of mystery, which hold all of the bulk items like oats, rice, pasta, as well as random stuff like cereal and chocolate bars and chips. Here&rsquo;s the thing about the aisles: they carry mostly packaged food. This means mostly expensive food. Oats are relatively cheap. Dried oats packaged with a few chocolate chips and raisins and labeled as &ldquo;trail mix&rdquo; tend to be really expensive, especially if you shop at a silly organic store like me. Corn is cheap at most stores. Corn tortillas are cheap at most stores. Corn chips were over $7 a bag at my store. Ridiculous. Basically what I&rsquo;m saying here, is avoid the aisles as much as possible. Tomato sauce is cheap to make, tomato sauce in a prepackaged container is expensive, especially if the label is pretty. Salsa is cheap to make, but the handmade custom salsa from Aunt Marge down the road (local?) is $6 for a tiny amount. The other thing to watch it for is the deli &amp; bakery sections. Often, chicken thighs will cost under $4 per pound. Marinated chicken thighs in the &ldquo;fancy meat&rdquo; section cost $8 per pound. Marinating is not difficult, yet it doubles the price of the chicken. You are paying for laziness and ignorance. It&rsquo;s your choice if you want to, but I generally avoided all of that because I&rsquo;m not rich.</p>
<p>While Walmart may be the cheapest, if you avoid the aisles, most grocery stores tend to sell bananas for about the same price, and chicken is expensive no matter where you go. With that in mind, I try to support local businesses if I can, espeically the local Indian and Korean grocery store in my area that have fantastic selection of spices, chili oils, cheap rice, and cool cuts of meat like short ribs and halibut.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-map-out-the-grocery-store">Step 2: Map out the grocery store</h2>
<p>Assuming this isn&rsquo;t your first time in the grocery store, you should have a good general idea of where everything you tend to buy is located. Before we make our shopping list, we need to know the most efficient plan of attack for getting in and out of this big box as quickly as possible. I drew a little map of mine showing all of the major sections, as well as my walking route in red. The key here is to <em>never backtrack</em>. If you&rsquo;re going back to the same section twice in one trip, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve failed to plan properly, so you&rsquo;re either a masochist or you&hellip; like grocery shopping? This is unacceptable behavior. Make a map, it&rsquo;s easy, all it takes is a pen and paper.</p>
<p><img src="/grocery-store-map.png" alt="A map of my local grocery store showing my optimized route"></p>
<h2 id="step-3-plan-your-shopping-list">Step 3: Plan your shopping list</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little secret about shopping lists &ndash; they&rsquo;re mostly the same from week to week. For example, I buy the following ingredients every single time I go to the grocery store: garlic, onions (some variety), tomatoes, chile peppers, cilantro, lemon/lime (they&rsquo;re mostly interchangeable). If you look closely, these are also the ingredients needed to make salsa, my favorite food! Whether I&rsquo;m making a Mexican dish, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, American, or some other type of cuisine, I&rsquo;m most likely going to use onion and garlic, some type of citrus, and I&rsquo;m too big of a fan of tomatoes, chiles, and cilantro to go more than a few days without eating them. Needless to say, I learned this information by keeping the same shopping list on my phone everytime I went and realizing that I rarely added or removed items. Often, I would have 1-5 specialty items per trip that rotated between different fruits or vegetables (depending on what&rsquo;s in season if you&rsquo;re a cooking genius), or different types of meat/cheese if I was feeling rich or craving a very specific type of dish. And the list doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything fancy. On a smartphone, Apple Notes or Google Keep works just fine to keep a checklist. There are a myriad number of other technologies that do the same thing, but I just keep one on my phone and check the boxes when I buy them, and uncheck the boxes when I run out of them at home. A paper list written in pen, using a pencil to check the boxes and an eraser to uncheck the boxes is a good solution too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you should write out your shopping list in the same order that you plan to walk through the store. As you can see from my photo, this means I break everything down into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce</li>
<li>Frozen</li>
<li>Dairy</li>
<li>Aisles</li>
<li>Meat</li>
<li>Misc (bread, alcohol, bulk)</li>
</ul>
<p>You might notice that my map shows me winding through the aisles interspersed with the dairy/meat sections. Oftentimes, it&rsquo;s more efficient to go from one section to the next and back if they&rsquo;re right next to eachother, as long as you&rsquo;re not repeating your steps. I&rsquo;m not actually serious about backtracking, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal, but if you&rsquo;re trying to set a new grocery store time PR, avoid it! I only say this because I wandered aimlessly around the grocery store for years, and often, ended up in the same aisles over and over again out of sheer stupidity.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-the-list">Step 4: The list</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I do. I don&rsquo;t buy every item every time I go to the store, which is why I would recommend making this a checkbox-style list (the WYSIWYG editor won&rsquo;t let me do that in this article). Again, when I plan my meals for the week, I just go through this list and just uncheck everything I don&rsquo;t currently have. Often, I&rsquo;ll have plenty of pasta and rice since they are shelf-stable, so I rarely uncheck those boxes. If I buy enough in bulk, a dream grocery store run involves only buying the produce, dairy, and meat that I&rsquo;ve run out of. Most everything else keeps for a while, and bulk buying is cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>FRESH</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VEGGIES: Tomatoes, Garlic, Onion (red, white, yellow), Chiles (jalapeno, serrano, habanero, etc.), Lettuce, Spinach, Broccoli, Cucumber, Potatos, Sweet potatos, Cilantro, Dill, Basil</li>
<li>FRUITS: Bananas, Lemon/Limes, Oranges/Apples/Grapes</li>
<li>MEAT: Chicken (thighs,breasts,whole,rotisserie), Fish</li>
<li>DAIRY: Full-fat Yogurt, Parmesan, Feta, Mexican blend cheese, Butter</li>
<li>GRAINS: Fresh bread (preferably sourdough), Fresh tortillas (corn or wheat)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FRIDGE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frozen berries for smoothies</li>
<li>Frozen veggies &amp; Frozen chicken for emergency meals</li>
<li>White wine, Red wine, Craft beer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PANTRY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GRAINS: Oats, Brown rice, Spaghetti, Rigatoni</li>
<li>LEGUMES: Black beans, Pinto beans, Chickpeas, White beans, Lentils</li>
<li>NUTS: Peanut butter, Cashews, Almonds</li>
<li>MISC: Tomatoes (canned tomatos are great when tomatos are out of season, san marzano are great for making pasta sauces)</li>
<li>OILS: Olive oil (extra-virgin), Avocado oil</li>
<li>LIQUIDS: Veggie stock, White wine vinegar, Red wine vinegar</li>
<li>SPICES: (buy in bulk somewhere else, typically very expensive at grocery stores) Kosher salt, Fresh ground black pepper, Cayenne, Cumin, Red pepper flakes, Oregano, Turmeric, Garam masala</li>
<li>MISC: Whole coffee beans, Green tea</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-5-hit-new-personalrecords">Step 5: Hit new Personal Records!</h2>
<p>Get out there and shop. I know it’s tough out there, and the bigger the grocery store, the harder the challenge, especially if you have to hit multiple grocery stores in one trip. But with a little preparation, it’s not nearly as hard or as bad as it seems. Plus, if you’re grocery has a bar selling $3 local craft beer, there’s all the more reason to go fast and spend more time sippin’ suds!</p>
