<h1>I Outrun My Thoughts</h1>

<p>I’m not particularly fast, nor strong, and my physique doesn’t reflect the amount of exercise I do. And that’s okay. I get something far more important from exercise than any of those quantifiable metrics: joy.</p>
<p>My rational brain tells me to exercise for health. There are numerous long-term benefits from cardio-respiratory training, resistance training, and mobility training. Improve your aerobic fitness and reduce your chance of heart disease. Improve your strength and reduce your age-related muscular decline and associated effects like fall risk. Train long-duration endurance and improve the ability of your mitochondria to burn stored lipids instead of glucose to reduce body fat percentage. Improve hip and shoulder mobility to fix your posture, reduce the chance of back injuries, and gain more influence socially. Train your lateral deltoids, upper trapezius, biceps, triceps, and lats to improve your chance of getting dates. Do a sprint workout to improve your muscular growth and testosterone levels. Run this fast, this much distance, lift this much weight, and you’ll finally be happy, but not until you look like this, and hit the right number on the scale.</p>
<p>Fuck that. When I’ve had a bad day, none of those little factoids make me feel better. When I don’t care about eating, I sure as hell don’t care about long-term aerobic health to prevent heart disease forty years from now. I’ve never been able to eat enough to grow my muscles much bigger than the default factory setting. I’ve exercised consistently for a decade now, and have hardly anything to show for it, except for probably improved general health. And as grateful as I am for my health, there have been times where the lack of external progress has saddened me. The body dysmorphia we get from looking at pictures of famous actors who (mostly) all use steroids, workout three hours per day, and have professional chefs is all too real. When we look in the mirror with images of those fakers surrounding us, it’s easy to feel like a failure. I’ve lifted 300 pounds before and felt weak. I’ve run sub-7 minute miles and felt slow. I’ve done 10 pull-ups and still looked like an average dude. What’s the point of it all if I can’t brag on the internet about my gorilla strength, cheetah speed, or godlike physique?</p>
<p>Here’s the hard truth: I’m going to keep training the rest of my life, and eventually I’ll be able to lift 0 pounds, my mile time will be infinity, and my physique will shrivel up, decay into the dirt, and be eaten by worms. There is no getting over the fact that after the age of 28 when I reach my peak physical potential, it’s a long race to the dirt. There is no way that 50 year old me can outrun 17 year old me who ran cross country. There is no way 70 year old me can out-lift 22 year old me who had two hours to lift per day. Without a doubt, I will get slower, I will get weaker, and I will get shorter and smaller. Yet I’ll keep doing it, day after day, and I know in my heart that I will get better. Because it’s not about the physique. It’s not about the distance you run, or how fast you do it. It’s not about the amount of weight you lift. It’s not about any of the numbers, not even the scale.</p>
<p>For me, it’s not about the long-term health benefits either. When I have rough days, or rough months, and all I want to do is sleep and be sad and wallow in self-pity, none of those numbers matter. After I lay on the floor face down in the most dramatic display of angst I can think of, heart disease is the last thing on my mind. But I still get up and go exercise. I’m not an athlete, I don’t do it for a living, and like I’ve said, I’m not even particularly good at any one movement, at least not compared to how much I’ve practiced them over the years. Yet I keep going, because in those dark times, I remember one thing: behavior changes thought. Years ago, I read this book by psychologist Jonathan Haidt called <em>The Righteous Mind</em>, where he discusses the analogy of the elephant and the rider. Basically, the elephant is our unconscious mind, full of emotions, predispositions, and genetics. The rider is our conscious, thinking, rational mind, that tries to lead the elephant. But if you know anything about elephants, they’re basically the most stubborn animal on the planet, and a little human riding on top of them will barely convince them to do anything. You can rationalize with an elephant all you want, but you have to remember that they don’t speak English. A tasty snack might influence them a bit, but for the most part, the elephant is going to go where the elephant wants to go. The analogy here is that as much as we try to rationalize with ourselves about why we should do something, like exercise, it’s not going to work. I’m sure, like me, you already know more facts about the benefits of exercise than you will ever need to regurgitate on some non-existent life test. Overtime, these facts may slowly move your elephant in the direction of exercise, but my rider seems to be wholly incompetent, and often asleep at the reins. The elephant moves anyways.</p>
<p>During those dark, angsty days, I’ll go for a run. I know rationally that it’s a 100% slam dunk for my life. It’ll make me better, it’ll improve my fitness, et cetera, et cetera. Unlike drugs, which are dubiously beneficial, or not, depending on the context, there’s no convincing needed that a run is beneficial. But when I’m not thinking rationally, I’m chasing one thing: play. I want to feel like a dog running in a field, tongue out, smiling, appreciating the trees for being tall, and the grass for swaying in the wind. On these days, when I go for a run, I stop whenever I feel tired. I give my calves a break. I walk as much as I want. I run as much as I want. I jog slowly when the view is beautiful. I sprint up stairs and only make it halfway because it’s a lot harder than it looks. I stop and peer into the water, trying to see fish or turtles or anything else exciting and wonderful. I stop to look at the shockingly red flowers on the side of the trail that I somehow didn’t see the day before. I jog slowly until I feel that burst of energy well up inside of me, and all of a sudden I’m running as fast as the wind. At the end of it all, I’m not sure how long I was out there, nor how far I went. It’s not about the time, the distance, or approaching some far away long-term goal. Sure, those are great for temporary motivation, but they don’t really mean much in practice. Those things don’t get me up off the floor, and they certainly don’t make me feel better about myself.</p>
<p>When my breath labors, and my calves are feeling the burn, and it’s hard to keep my core tight because of how tired I am, and my feet are thudding against the ground, I feel alive. I feel capable and confident that I can move forward against the pain, that I can feel this way, feel the struggle, and the hurt, and the hard, and keep moving forward. That I can find the joy in the journey, and know that today, I did something to feel better. I’m not hard on myself. I don’t care about the time. I’ve gone on plenty of 1-minute runs. I can run slower than your walking pace. Hell, I walk half the time anyways because I love walking too. All that matters is that I got outside, into the glorious sunlight, touched grass with my feet, saw leaves and bugs and animals with my eyes, and allowed myself to run away from whatever problems I had, and finally shut my brain off. We can’t out-think the elephant, it’s going to go wherever it wants. But when I go for a run, I get out ahead of the elephant, and it starts to chase me. Like a big dog, it loves a pack-mate to play with, and strangely enough, I can be that for myself. I can lead my sad thoughts away from the darkness and into the light, and even if it doesn’t last all day, it makes me feel better for a while. Eventually, after enough days running, I know that my behavior will force my thoughts to improve. My dopamine will begin to regulate from the voluntary challenges and mild pain I put my body through. My confidence will rise from the progress each mile brings. It’s literally moving forward, both metaphorically and literally, doing the thing humans have always done. And while I may never see the external benefits from this run, or the next, or the next thousand miles, those thoughts don’t matter. All it takes is a few minutes of running to improve my life in the here and now.</p>
