<p>Okay, so you now have a computer (honestly you probably had one already and skipped [How to select a good computer](How to computer)), what OS? Kidding, I know that most computers already come with an Operating System, so good news &ndash; it&rsquo;s probably fine to just stick with what you&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;re all pretty good these days.</p>
<h1 id="macos---a-good-unix-style-os">MacOS - a good Unix-style OS</h1>
<p>If you buy a Macbook and it comes with MacOS, keep it. Otherwise it&rsquo;s pretty hard to get MacOS. It&rsquo;s nothing special compared to Linux, it&rsquo;s actually just very similar. It&rsquo;s a great operating system for most people. You can always dual-boot Windows or Linux later, for free, if you choose to. Or switch completely to one of the other two.</p>
<p>Really the only way to get MacOS is to buy an Apple laptop. You could try to make a Hackintosh, but this guide isn&rsquo;t for that. Just think of MacOS as very similar to Linux (they&rsquo;re both from the Unix family of OSs for the history nerds), so they&rsquo;re practically interchangeable. At least as far as software goes.</p>
<h2 id="linux---a-free-unix-style-os">Linux - a free Unix-style OS</h2>
<p>If your computer doesn&rsquo;t come with an OS, <a href="simple-software">download Linux</a>. Linux is free, the code is open source (actually a good thing, it means more great coders are looking at the source code regularly and fixing bugs and vulnerabilities &ndash; the key to software security is reaction time), making it extremely simple, fast, and lightweight. Modern flavors like Ubuntu and CentOS have easy to use interfaces. Downside, it&rsquo;s tough to install if you don&rsquo;t already know how, but fun to learn for tech people.</p>
<p>Also, Linux is always free to download and is developed worldwide by some of the best programmers out there. It&rsquo;s truly an amazing social feat of humanity.</p>
<h2 id="windows---fine">Windows - fine</h2>
<p>If you already have Windows, cool. It&rsquo;s a good OS, and is widely used in industry. The major distinction in the software world is between Windows and Unix. MacOS and Linux are both Unix-style operating systems, meaning they revolve around the command line and have a similar file structure. I find them much easier to use, but I&rsquo;ve used Windows extensively my whole life.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the reality of the world &ndash; Unix is better for software people because it&rsquo;s simpler and cleaner, Windows is better for the business world because it&rsquo;s effective and works &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; Any good computer programmer or scientist can use both, because they&rsquo;re still quite similar.</p>
