<h1>Simple Hygiene</h1>

<h2 id="a-note-on-taking-a-random-persons-medical-advice-dont">A note on taking a random person&rsquo;s medical advice: don&rsquo;t</h2>
<p>So much related to general health and hygiene should come from your personal doctors who gives you checkups, so I don&rsquo;t have much more advice to give, besides listen to the professionals. Sure, some of them are in the pockets of big-pharma, but for the most part, they have good advice. Get a second opinion if you want, but this is <em>not</em> really the area to &ldquo;do your own research&rdquo;, since the field of medicine is legitimately insanely complex and difficult to understand. It&rsquo;s not like fixing your own car, which can be done by reading the manual. Of course, that could kill you too if you mess up, so be cautious there.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m mainly writing this because I&rsquo;ve never seen a comprehensive list like this, and am curious about how other people view this topic. The point is, nothing in life is &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to people who don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s why learning is a thing.</p>
<h2 id="hygiene-practices">Hygiene practices</h2>
<p>Daily Hygiene</p>
<ul>
<li>brush teeth 2x per day, floss 1x per day [1]</li>
<li>protect eyes with sunglasses (multiple optometrists have told me this is the single most important thing you can do for lifelong eye health [2]</li>
<li>wear sunscreen (especially on your face) and moisturize (not sure why) [3]</li>
<li>shower daily-ish (the less you shower, the more water you conserve for nature)
<ul>
<li>bonus for using cold water, it releases dopamine and feels great&hellip; afterwards haha</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pee/poo as needed, but make sure you enjoy life&rsquo;s simple pleasures :)</li>
<li>wash your hands before you handle food, or before sticking your hand in your mouth/eyes/etc
<ul>
<li>similar to wearing a mask, this may not always be necessary for your own health, but it helps prevent the spread of disease, potentially saving the lives of elderly and infant humans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clean surfaces in your kitchen, especially countertops, and clean dishes</li>
</ul>
<p>Weekly Hygiene</p>
<ul>
<li>wash hair somewhere between every other day and every month
<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t know exactly what to do here, but I&rsquo;ve heard that sulfates/sulfites are terrible for hair, so I would air on the side of natural soaps / Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clean all textiles (clothes/sheets/towels) that touch your body weekly, same soap recommendations, go for natural / Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s</li>
<li>clean environment around you weekly - dust surfaces, sweep/vaccuum floors, clean sinks, toilets, shower, other appliances</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;Monthly Hygiene</p>
<ul>
<li>visit the dentist every 6 months [1]</li>
<li>get an eye exam once per year [2]</li>
<li>get a skin exam once per year [3]</li>
<li>get a general physician exam once per year</li>
</ul>
