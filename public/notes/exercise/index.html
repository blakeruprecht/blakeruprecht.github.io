<h1>exercise</h1>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Focus on proper technique for all movement, from breathing and standing, to running and lifting.
Build strength thru training pushing, pulling, and squatting movements.
Train Zone 2 cardio a lot each week.
Train Zone 4/5 cardio some each week.</p>
<h2 id="physiological-adaptations-of-the-body-to-exercise-1">Physiological Adaptations of the Body to Exercise [1]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anaerobic endurance: max heart rate, how much work you can do at max effort</li>
<li>Aerobic endurance: bodies ability to efficiently use oxygen during exercise</li>
<li>Long-duration endurance: how long your body can perform sub-maximal work</li>
<li>Technique: learning to move more effectively, efficiently, smoothly, and reducing risk of injury</li>
<li>Muscular Endurance: how many reps in a row you can do</li>
<li>Strength: how effectively you can move something</li>
<li>Speed: moving at a higher velocity or with more accelaration</li>
<li>Power: speed multiplied by force</li>
<li>Size: how big the muscle is</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="training-pillars-2">Training Pillars [2]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stability
<ul>
<li>Proper technique in all things, this is the most complicated topic here by far, it&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;good form&rdquo;, which changes from exercise to exercise, and needs to be evaluated for each joint and each muscle individually.</li>
<li>Stability starts with nose-breathing</li>
<li>Stability includes proper posture, treat every movement you perform in life like an exercise, e.g. there is a proper form to sitting, to standing, to walking, to swimming, to swinging from trees, to chopping vegetables, to lifting things up off the ground, etc.</li>
<li>I can help you find more information on proper form, but don&rsquo;t feel like typing it out right now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strength: perform pushing, pulling, and squat hygiene each week [3]
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges">K Boges</a> calls this &ldquo;hygiene&rdquo;, which I think is a great term. He&rsquo;s a super knowledgeable dude with the most minimalist strength training routine I have ever seen, and some great youtube videos going into depth</li>
<li>His routine is simple, as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pick one pushing exercise e.g. Pushup, Close-grip Pushup, Dip, etc.</li>
<li>Pick one pulling exercise e.g. Pullup, Chinup, Inverted Row, etc.</li>
<li>pick one leg exercise e.g. Bodyweight Squat, Lunge, etc.</li>
<li>perform 3 sets of close-to-max effort training for each movement, whenever you want, split up the different exercises throughout the day, try to keep all pushup sets together however, same for pulling and squats</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perform plenty of Zone 2 training each week
<ul>
<li>Plenty is somewhere between two 30-min sessions and 180 mins of total work, work up to it</li>
<li>As fast as you can go while still nose-breathing</li>
<li>e.g. Run, Bicycle, Skip rope, Row, Swim, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perform some Zone 4/5 training each week
<ul>
<li>One or two sessions a week is sufficient
<ul>
<li>e.g. 10 max effort sprints for 60 seconds with 2-4 minutes rest</li>
<li>e.g. interval run, 4 minutes close to all out, 4 minutes slow, for 4 cycles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This should be close to max effort or max effort</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though there are three physical adaptations to cardio, aerobic and long-duration training can be trained at the same time by doing large volumes of Zone 2 (as fast as you can go while still nose-breathing) training in some modality like running, skipping rope, swimming, biking, etc.</p>
