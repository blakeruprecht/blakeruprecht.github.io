<h1>nutrition</h1>

<h2 id="eat-as-much-energy-as-you-burn-roughly">Eat as much energy as you burn, roughly</h2>
<p>Food is energy for the body. Without enough energy, the body will slowly starve, leading to early death. With too much energy, the body will store the excess as body fat. Excess amounts of body fat can lead to many serious health problems, including early death. Neither of these are recommended. However, there is a range of weight for any given person in which they can be perfectly healthy, and any minor differences within that range have nothing to do with nutrition, so that discussion falls outside the scope of these notes.</p>
<h2 id="follow-mediterranean-guidelines-to-get-all-the-right-nutrients">Follow Mediterranean guidelines to get all the right nutrients</h2>
<p>Besides energy, food also contains many essential nutrients for bodily processes, of which water, the 10 essential amino acids, unsaturated &amp; saturated fats, 15-25 chemical elements (previously called minerals), 13 vitamins, and fiber must be eaten and cannot be produced by the body. Carbs aren&rsquo;t technically necessary nutrient wise, but provide a great source of energy for the body and are nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>To eat the right proportion of nutrients, follow the Mediterranean eating plan (otherwise called &ldquo;diet&rdquo;, which is technically accurate, but that word carries a lot of stigma). The emphasis on eating a variety of vegetables, fruits, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole-grains plus plenty of olive oil helps ensure you receive all essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, carbs, fats, and proteins. Beans + whole-grains ensure adequate amino acid intake, chicken, poultry, fish, and other meats can be added as you please, but not necessary. Avoid all trans fats, avoid processed sugars, basically avoid food that comes out of a package or drive-thru. Of course, you can make concessions for convenience, but it will only be at the expense of your long-term health, which you trade for more time now. Eat wisely.</p>
<h2 id="learn-to-cook">Learn to cook</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read <em>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</em> by Samin Nosrat
<ul>
<li>Add salt to bring out flavor, stop just before it tastes too salty. You&rsquo;ll have to train your taste buds on this one.</li>
<li>Fat brings out flavor, so don&rsquo;t ever skimp on fat.</li>
<li>Acid makes the mouth water, if you already have salt and fat, you&rsquo;ll probably need to add some acid to get your food to taste good</li>
<li>Heat: there are many methods to cook food, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice cooking meals you enjoy. Just like with everything, the secret to getting good at cooking is practice, practice, practice. Personally, I only cook my absolute favorite meals so that I&rsquo;m excited to make them. Luckily, I have a ton of favorites.</li>
<li>Remember that recipes are just suggestions, and most of them are very similar.</li>
<li>Learn to recreate a TexMex burrito bowl, and you&rsquo;ll master basically all parts of cooking, e.g.
<ul>
<li>Grains are typically pretty easy and just require a pot of boiling water (brown rice, pasta)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s great to know how to make tasty beans, in this case, black or refried with some jalapeno and spices</li>
<li>Making delicious grilled chicken is easy if you marinate it in yogurt/mayo and salt 30mins or more before you cook it. Cook it on a cast-iron (or equivalent) to really get some charred skin.</li>
<li>Chop up tomatoes, onions, garlic, jalapenos, cilantro, and limes to create a fresh pico de gallo salsa. Once you can nail the salt/acid ratio on this, you&rsquo;ll be set to cook most anything.</li>
<li>Top with avocado, cheese, yogurt, tortillas.
<ul>
<li>Bonus: learn to make masa tortillas by hand, it&rsquo;s easy and delicious</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learn-to-grocery-shop-garden--forage">Learn to grocery shop, garden, &amp; forage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to find fresh, high quality, whole foods</li>
<li>The absolute best produce comes from local gardens, local farmers markets, etc.</li>
<li>The best meat and eggs come from neighbor&rsquo;s chicken coops, or local farms</li>
<li>Cicero said &ldquo;if you have a library and a garden, you have all you need&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biochemistry-summary">Biochemistry Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Food is necessary for energy, and also the proper functioning of different chemical processes in the body.</li>
<li>There are seven major nutrients, which can be split up into macro- and micro-
<ul>
<li>Macronutrients
<ul>
<li>Water (no energy): essential to replace water lost through urine/feces/sweat/breathing, the modern recommendation is drink when you are thirsty since the amount needed varies based on age, activity level, local weather, etc.</li>
<li>Protein (17 kJ/g or 4 kcal/g): essential to build many structures in the body like muscles, skin, hair, there are 10 essential amino acids found in complete proteins (e.g. chicken) or can be found by combining two incomplete proteins (e.g. rice and beans) which works just as well, provided you eat <em>enough</em> protein, e.g. for athletic people, 0.7g/lb of bodyweight per day.</li>
<li>Fats (37 kJ/g or 9 kcal/g): essential to build cells and signalling molecules, eliminate all trans fats, eat both saturated (e.g. animal fats, coconut oil) and unsaturated (e.g. plant/fish fats) fats</li>
<li>Carbohydrates (17 kJ/g or 4 kcal/g): technically not essential to eat, but they are a great energy source, mono- and di- saccharides are worse than polysaccharides (complex carbs), though all provide energy. Mono- di- are bad for your teeth since they stick to them and allow plaque to build up, whereas poly- don&rsquo;t. Recommendation, eat whole-grains, eliminate simple sugars and processed sugars. So no sweets/white bread, or limit as much as possible.</li>
<li>Fiber (no energy): necessary, helps with digestion, found in whole-grains and many vegetables so stick to Med. diet and you&rsquo;ll be fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Micronutrients
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Minerals&rdquo;: really chemical elements, 15-25 are essential for many different processes in the body, best recommendation is to eat Mediterranean diet and get blood tests for deficiencies/excessed</li>
<li>Vitamins: there are 13 essential ones, found in many different foods, also serving many varied purposes in the body, best recommendation is to follow Med. &amp; get blood tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biochemistry-of-the-macronutrients">Biochemistry of the Macronutrients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Carbohydrates: made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, e.g. glucose is C^(6)H^(12)O^(6)
<ul>
<li>Technically not necessary for humans to eat since proteins and fats can be converted into glucose for energy through a process called ketosis (similar to what sled dogs do)</li>
<li>There are mono-, di-, and poly- saccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain (1, 2, 3 or more)</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Mono: glucose, fructose, lactose</li>
<li>Di: sucrose, lactose, maltose</li>
<li>Poly: starch, glycogen (these are the &ldquo;complex&rdquo; carbs)
<ul>
<li>Cooking starch makes it more easily digestible</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fats: made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen
<ul>
<li>Dietary fat consists of several fatty acids bonded to a glycerol
<ul>
<li>e.g. triglycerides are three fatty acides bonded to one glycerol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Saturated fats have all carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms
<ul>
<li>Likely to be solid at room temperature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unsaturated fats have some carbon atoms double bonded, so less total hydrogen per unit length
<ul>
<li>Either have one double bond (monounsaturated) or many (polyunsaturated)</li>
<li>Depending on location of double bond, classified as either Omega-3 or Omega-6
<ul>
<li>These are the two <em>essential</em> fatty acids since the body cannot produce them</li>
<li>Marine food sources are high in Omega-3 (e.g. fish)</li>
<li>Veggie oils have both O-3 and O-6, but much higher in O-6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trans Fats have trans-isomer bonds, rare in nature, typically created through an industrial process called hydrogenation. These are universally regarded as bad for humans by everyone except companies who sell them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fiber: a special type of polysaccharide that is incompletely absorbed by humans
<ul>
<li>Insoluble fiber (e.g. cellulose) is indigestible, e.g. resistant starch can be fermented by microbes in the stomach to produce short-chain fatty acids, utilized by colon cells for food</li>
<li>Soluble fiber (e.g. waxes, esters, oligosaccharides) dissolve/gelatinize in water, can also be fermented</li>
<li>Fiber adds bulk to the intestinal content of food</li>
<li>Fiber helps peristalsis, the muscular contraction of the intestines which moves food along the digestive track (cool to remember the intestines are muscles too)</li>
<li>Some fiber creates a more viscous solution, slowing the transport of food through the intestines (this seems in opposition to the last point)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proteins (really, amino acids): made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen
<ul>
<li>Form the basis of many structures of the body, e.g. muscle, skin, hair, and form the enzymes which control chemical reactions in the body</li>
<li>Absorbed into the blood in the small intestine, cannot be stored, so are either burnt for energy (metabolized) or sent off into the urine to be <em>removed</em></li>
<li>Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions</li>
<li>Some amino acids are essential, can&rsquo;t be produced in the body
<ul>
<li>Human body requires 10 or so, a <em>complete</em> protein has all 10 e.g. chicken
<ul>
<li>It is possible to combine two incomplete proteins to form all 10, e.g. rice and beans. This forms the foundation of many cuisines</li>
<li>A well planned vegan diet can easily get enough protein, as long as all 10 amino acids are eaten roughly every day, e.g. to build muscle eat 0.7g per pound of bodyweight</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Water: you know what it is, <em>dun duh nuh nahhhhh</em>
<ul>
<li>We already got water in the body, but we lose it through urine, defecation, sweating, and exhaling breath, so we have to replace it</li>
<li>The amount you need to drink depends on how much you pee, poo, sweat, and breathe, so it is different for everybody, e.g. if you&rsquo;re a sweaty dude, drink more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alcohol is technically a macro-, the body burns alcohol as energy at 7 kcal/g, they contribute no essential nutrients, and alcohol is burned in the body before any of the other macronutrient energy sources, so if you eat lots of food and drink alcohol, some of that food excess energy will be stored as body fat, e.g. beer bellies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biochemistry-of-the-micronutrients">Biochemistry of the Micronutrients</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Minerals&rdquo;: really just other chemical elements found in food that humans need, not just minerals
<ul>
<li>Besides Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen, humans also need roughly 15-25 other elements (some are still beign debated) from the periodic table i.e. inorganic elements</li>
<li>Some are cofactors, others are electrolytes
<ul>
<li>Cofactors are elements that help amino acids create enzymes</li>
<li>Electrolytes are ions that help conduct electricity through the movement of the ion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macrominerals (humans need &gt; 150 mg/day): These are the big ones
<ul>
<li>Calcium: vital for health of muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems. Builds bone. Supports creation of blood cells. Helps contract muscles, nerve conduction, blood clotting. It&rsquo;s a beast.</li>
<li>Chlorine (as chloride ions): common electrolyte</li>
<li>Magnesium: required for processing ATP and related reactions, e.g. bone building, peristalsis, flexibility (woah), alkalinity.
<ul>
<li>Found in oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, legumes, chocolate, green leafy veggies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phosphorous: required in bones, essential for energy processing, found in every cell, found in DNA/RNA/ATP/etc
<ul>
<li>Found in cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potassium: common electrolyte for heart and nerve function, with sodium maintains normal water balance in cells (the Na-K pump), acid-base balance, regulates neuromusclar activity
<ul>
<li>Found in bananas, avocados, nuts, veggies, potatoes, legumes, fish, mushrooms</li>
<li>Fun fact, if you get cramps while running, eating bananas can help fix this because they are high in potassium and it helps with neuromusclar activity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sodium: common electrolyte, found in most foods as salt (sodium-chloride)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microminerals: you need trace amounts, all of these help with chemical processes in the body with names longer than I feel like typing out
<ul>
<li>Cobalt, Copper, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Selenium, Zinc
<ul>
<li>Iodine is special and you need more of it, but not special enough to make the big leagues, get it in iodized salt and kombu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultratrace minerals: you need a tiny bit, maybe, we&rsquo;ve yet to prove it
<ul>
<li>Bromine, Arsenic, Nickel, Flourine, Boron, Lithium, Strontium, Silicon, Vanadium</li>
<li>Seems like you can get most of these by opening up a computer and licking the parst (kidding don&rsquo;t sue me)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vitamins: essential for good health
<ul>
<li>There are thirteen essential vitamins. You gotta wonder what happened to Vitamins B4, B8, B10, B11, F, G, H, I, and J.
<ul>
<li>Vitamin A (all-trans-retinols, all-trans-retinyl-esters, as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids)</li>
<li>Vitamin B1 (thiamine)</li>
<li>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)</li>
<li>Vitamin B3 (niacin)</li>
<li>Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)</li>
<li>Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)</li>
<li>Vitamin B7 (biotin)</li>
<li>Vitamin B9 (folic acid and folates)</li>
<li>Vitamin B12 (cobalamins)</li>
<li>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid and ascorbates)</li>
<li>Vitamin D (calciferols): can actually be created in the body in the presence of UVB radiation (sunlight, basically), so you don&rsquo;t always have to eat this if you get enough sunlight, I don&rsquo;t know what enough is</li>
<li>Vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols)</li>
<li>Vitamin K (phylloquinones, menaquinones, and menadiones)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frontiers-of-nutritional-biochemistry">Frontiers of Nutritional Biochemistry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Antioxidants
<ul>
<li>A common buzzword nowadays, these have not been shown to be essential to human nutrition because of poor bioavailability i.e. they get pee/pooed out</li>
<li>As per usual, it&rsquo;s all just bullshit marketing, follow the Mediterranean diet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intestinal microbiome / Gut flora
<ul>
<li>There are many tiny little bacteria, archaea, and fungi that help us with digestion. They are friends, not foe. They help digest food, produce fatty acids, and make vitamins available.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have any recommendations here besides eat the&hellip; you guessed it, CARNIVORE diet! Haha, obviously not, follow the good ol&rsquo; Mediterranean diet. Maybe add in some fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, soy sauce, beer? I dunno man. Seems like if you eat clean, these little dudes will be kept healthy.</li>
<li>Just like with everything, don&rsquo;t fall for the stupid marketing tricks, drinking kombucha is not going to make up for lack of vegetables and exercise.</li>
