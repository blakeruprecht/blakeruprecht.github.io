<p>Yeah honestly, this could pretty much just be called the &ldquo;frugal farmers diet&rdquo;, seems applicable to anywhere on earth where people subsistence farm, or at least grow a vegetable garden. It seems like half of human health is pretty much solved if you can figure out how to eat a majority of your produce from a local/backyard garden or farm (grown and gathered locally). That&rsquo;s what humans have done for a long time, and most of those foods consisted of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, meats. But the paleo people are wrong, the human body has completely adapted in 10,000 to cereal grains, the sticking point is that processed white grains tend to be less complete from a micronutrient persepctive, making them less useful for overall health.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve adapted to bread. We can eat meat, seems like red meats may lead to some health problems, not sure if I buy that. They&rsquo;re definitely unsustainable unless sourced locally.</p>
<p>I still try to [eat high protein](&ldquo;Eat high protein&rdquo;.md).</p>
