<h1>Art</h1>

</span>

<p>My favorite art forms are black-ink drawings and woodworking. Here are a few of my best pieces from over the years.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-log-cabin.jpg" alt="Drawing of a log cabin I made up">
^ Done using sharpie on paper, based on the houses from <em>Your Cabin in the Woods</em> by Conrad Meinecke.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-fallingwater.jpg" alt="Ink dip pen drawing of Frank Lloyd Wright&amp;rsquo;s Fallingwater">
^ Done using a dip pen and black india ink. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallingwater">Fallingwater</a>, a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-chalkboard.jpg" alt="Calligraphy done on a chalkboard">
^ &hellip;enough, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the minimum. From <a href="/blog/kiss">KISS</a></p>
<p><img src="/drawing-relativity.jpg" alt="A doodle I did in class">
^ I particularly like black ink drawings with that bold, all-black shading style, though it&rsquo;s very hard to get right.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-eagle.jpg" alt="A doodle of an eagle">
^ On the flip side of that other doodle, I tried some pencil drawing, HB mechanicals don&rsquo;t get very dark&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-spartan.jpg" alt="A doodle of a spartan warrior">
^ Digital logic class was getting boring.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-ship.jpg" alt="A doodle of a ship">
^ &ldquo;There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-helicopter.jpg" alt="CAD drawing of a RC helicopter">
^ Okay, a computer-aided drawing, but it looks dope.</p>

<h2 id="sharpie-on-the-walls">Sharpie on the Walls</h2>
<p>I always used to get waves of creativity during finals week in college. This time, me and two of my best friends broke out some sharpies and redecorated my room. I needed some artwork and posters.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-frat-walls.jpg" alt="Doodles on my college bedroom wall">
^ Can you tell what my priorities were back then?</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-frat-walls3.jpg" alt="Doodles on my college bedroom wall">
^ This wasn&rsquo;t me, but Biggs is hilarious. The uke was me, you can see the real one in the bottom right.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-frat-walls2.jpg" alt="Doodles on my college bedroom wall">
^ Hadn&rsquo;t even graduated yet, but was already checked out. My sophomore year was my first &ldquo;Senior year&rdquo; since one of my best buddies was a senior, and every year after someone else was a senior, so I stopped taking college seriously after exactly one year. Coincidentally, I never bought a textbook after first semester, and it only hurt my grades one time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bday-card-series">Bday card series</h2>
<p>I love handmade everything, especially gifts. Excuse the black borders and poor white balance, I am a drawer, not photographer. I&rsquo;ve tried colors before in my drawings, don&rsquo;t like them, except for red, inspired by old Japanese sumi ink drawings. I have copic ink markers, but prefer pen shading to marker/water color shading.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-balloon.jpg" alt="Bday card doodle with balloon">
^ Red balloons only</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-beer.jpg" alt="Bday card of a beer can">
^ Bud Select is a family heirloom for us, my dad worked for A-B for 24 years, so you could say beer is in my blood. Bud Select is only brewed and distributed in St. Louis, so it holds a special place in my heart, and it conveniently has the right color scheme ;)</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-flowers.jpg" alt="Bday card of flowers">
^ One line, then three more in red.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-fishing.jpg" alt="Bday card of dude fishing">
^ I need a boat.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-cat.jpg" alt="Bday card of a hooded cat">
^ I copied a tattoo artist and added color, never making that mistake again.</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-spotify.jpg" alt="Bday card of a spotify song">
^ Haha, get it? Like spotify&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/drawing-bday-hbd.jpg" alt="Bday card hbd">
^ I mean c&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;m a minimalist, this one is my favorite.</p>

<h2 id="woodworking">Woodworking</h2>
<p>I love building furniture out of wood because I can make it exactly how I want it. I built all of this using a circ saw (sometimes chop saw), drill, and sander. Oh, and a reciprocating saw because cutting plywood on the ground is very hard.</p>
<p><img src="/wood-housedecks.jpg" alt="A large wooden sculpture">
^ Maybe hard to see, but this is a 3-d wood sculpture that I was lead builder on. That archway is cut out of plywood, along with the tree and buildings on the back. This whole thing is 16 feet tall, and the front two panels are both 8 feet wide and slide on a rail at the top. The year before, the dummies in charge built a rail out of 2x12s that weighed hundreds of pounds and needed 20+ people to hoist up, sketchy. This year, me and my buddy built this rail out of 2x4s and put it up ourselves. Engineering is frat.</p>
<p><img src="/wood-living-room.jpg" alt="Handmade coffee and console table">
^ Not very complicated, but hey, that&rsquo;s the joy of doing it yourself. I custom build that console to fit my speakers, and designed it so that I could get the Home Depot dudes to cut it for me (notice the cut ends stick out, so they don&rsquo;t need to be perfect) and the coffee table has some custom &ldquo;artwork&rdquo; made by wood burning and such.</p>
<p><img src="/wood-desk.jpg" alt="Handmade wood desk top">
^ I carried this plywood home from the lumber yard across the street. Even 200 meters of walking with plywood is a major PITA. I built that microwave too, it&rsquo;s actually a high-performance Deep Learning rig (mainly used for gaming).</p>
<p><img src="/wood-nightstand.jpg" alt="Handmade wood nightstand">
^ Built this out of plywood, my first time making a draw, really tricky. Wanted the most minimalist wood nighstand possible, found one online only in Australia for something like $400 and copied their design.</p>
<p><img src="/wood-squat-rack.jpg" alt="Handmade wood &amp; concrete &amp; bucket squat rack">
^ Built this squat rack to use with my barbell and weights. Inspector Mikey does not care one bit about squatting.</p>
<p><img src="/wood-framing.jpg" alt="Wooden framing">
^ I can frame, do some light plumbing &amp; electrical, drywall, etc. Not as fun as furniture.</p>
