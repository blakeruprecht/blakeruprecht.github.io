    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I feel hot breath on my neck as I run forward, bogged down by mud and debris. One nips at my shoes, opening up a whole in the left side of the upper. Another snatches a hole in my pants. One up them knocks dirt into my mouth, a problem that will have to be professionally repaired. I lose my vision as my contacts fall out from running, I have to rely on my old glasses which restrict my peripherals.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve gotten to my house. I&rsquo;ve had to flee, and they&rsquo;re chewing away at the walls. One of them bit into my store of food, ruining days worth of provisions.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t stop chasing me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to adjust my running form on the fly. Shorten my strides, rely less on outright power and plan for the long game.</p>
<p>I thought the wolves would look scary, but they don&rsquo;t. I hardly even feel the fear, it&rsquo;s so subtle. Like a tapeworm undetected, I don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s eating away at me until I look back at the decision and see the error.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just groceries and rent. And medical costs. And tool maintenance.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll just get a quick job to pay off my bills, and then I&rsquo;ll start living the life I want. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just get quick part-time job to stay afloat, and then I&rsquo;ll start living the life I want. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just sit in this house for a year and make no forward progress. Then I&rsquo;ll start living.</p>
<p>I can see the hesitation all over my recent path. The indecision masking the fear that is so ugly and huge I haven&rsquo;t acknowledged it even to myself. I wanted permission, some sign that I was on the right path. A published essay. Somebody telling me they&rsquo;d never read better writing. A hawk crossing my path at just the right time.</p>
<p>None of that happened.</p>
<p>There have been no signs, no helpful hints, no tricks. Just doubt and uncertainty hanging over my head everyday. I keep going back to the same strategies that aren&rsquo;t working, sending out tons of applications just to receive hundreds of rejection emails. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pursuing candidates who better fit this role.&rdquo; Where do I fit in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been so confused at every turn, constantly reevaluating and coming up with new plans and stressing the fuck out every time the new plan doesn&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;m so fucking sick of it, sick of grinding away to get positions I don&rsquo;t even want to keep living a lifestyle I hate. I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer for me is, but I know for sure it&rsquo;s not continuing to sit at this stupid desk in front of this window I can&rsquo;t open because of the car traffic in this house I don&rsquo;t like with roommates who don&rsquo;t get along in a city that screams against my soul.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been so <em>fearful</em> at every turn, constantly doubting myself and coming up with backup plans and stressing the fuck out every time the new plan doesn&rsquo;t align with my heart. I&rsquo;m sick of lying to myself and everyone else. I always knew this lifestyle wouldn&rsquo;t work for me. I left my parents house with no regrets. I left the house I shared with my first girlfriend, terrified of being tied down to a boring place. I moved into this boring place thinking things would be different since my friends were here. Now I&rsquo;m just bored by my friends.</p>
<p>There are great adventures to be had in this life, just not sitting at this desk putting my life on hold to follow a path that was never meant for me.</p>
<p>Lead</p>
<ul>
<li>job: pursue Writing &amp; Teaching with every action</li>
<li>location: go wherever my path takes me</li>
<li>fun: adventure, trying new things, thinking on my feet, camping, disc golf, adventure, parties with people who fill my soul</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow</p>
<ul>
<li>job: find any part-time job</li>
<li>location: stay in Denver, CO</li>
<li>fun: softball, disc golf, occasional parties</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth &ndash; staying in Denver is a losing battle, and every day I stay is one day closer to my eventual demise. I&rsquo;m wasting my life away waffling in indecision.</p>
