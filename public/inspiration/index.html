<blockquote>
<p>Look again at that dot. That&rsquo;s here. That&rsquo;s home. That&rsquo;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &ldquo;superstar,&rdquo; every &ldquo;supreme leader,&rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there&ndash;on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>
<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.</p>
<p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>
<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>
<p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&rsquo;ve ever known.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A poet once said, <em>&lsquo;The whole universe is in a glass of [beer].&rsquo;</em> We will probably never know in what sense he said that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look in glass of beer closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of the stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the beer? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in beer is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of beer without discovering the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of beer, this universe, into parts — physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on — remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let us give one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!</p>

<p>“Watching you grow up was a privliege. Then the time come for you to take on the world and be your own man, and you did, but somewhere along the line, you changed.</p>
<p>You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you’re no good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame. Like a big shadow.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place. And I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you permanently there if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.</p>
<p>But it ain’t about how hard you hit, it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!</p>
<p>Now if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you want to be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that, and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!</p>
<p>I’m always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You’re my son, you’re my blood. You’re the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in yourself, you ain’t gonna have a life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dopamine is the most important neurochemical to regulate.</li>
<li>Dopamine is the chemical that drives pursuit, it is literally the life giving spark in all animals.</li>
<li>Dopamine doesn&rsquo;t make us feel pleasure, it makes us pursue things. When we get pleasure without pursuit, aka heroin, drugs, porn-fueled masturbation, etc., it messes up our dopamine system. Dopamine gets jacked up in anticipation of easy pleasures, then crashes afterwards, preventing us from pursuing other things.</li>
<li>It leads to depression. The body doesn&rsquo;t experience the pain of pursuit, so it starts to raise the dopamine baseline until we only get pleasure from these specific activities.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Addiction is a gradual narrowing of the things that bring us pleasure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A fulfilled life is probably the opposite, where we can find pleasure from doing any action or pursuing any goal, rather than just a narrowly-defined set of goals, e.g. smoke weed and eat french fries.</li>

<p><em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Happiness = Setpoints + Conditions + Voluntary Actions</li>
<li><em>Setpoints</em> are the biological basis of human happiness. It refers to our neurochemical setpoints, the resting level of things like dopamine, sertonin, epinephrine, etc in the brain. They are mostly genetic and very hard to change. If these are out of whack and making you unhappy, there are only three scientifically proven interventions to fix them:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</strong>: The most highly regarded type of therapy which helps us identify our cognitive biases and distortions (untruths) and correct them to alter our brain chemistry.</li>
<li><strong>Medication</strong>: precribed by a Psychiatrist, medication designed to specifically alter brain chemicals.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/breathing">Meditation</a></strong>: I&rsquo;m not joking, meditation is literally one of the most powerful actions we have for improving our mental health, since it returns our bodies to our physiological baselines (read, it relaxes us).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Conditions</em> refer to the enduring, but not permanent, factors of our life like our <a href="working.md">jobs</a>, where we live, and the environmental problems we face in day to day life. The research shows that negative conditions can really impact our happiness, but positive conditions don&rsquo;t affect it much. Think about it like this &ndash; the brain would much rather remove some pain from life than add in some new pleasures. Fixing an annoying leaky faucet or moving away from toxic neighbors does a lot more than upgrading to a luxury car for our happiness.</li>
<li><em>Actions</em> refer to the activities we choose to do daily. Outside of the conditions of our life like our jobs and homes, we have a lot of choice each day &ndash; what to eat, when to sleep, how to take care of ourselves, what exercise and hobbies to do, who to hangout with, and more. The most important voluntary actions for human happiness are not very surprising:
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> with other people.</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong> activities are challenging enought to engage us, but not frustrate us, and interesting enough to keep us involved. You know you&rsquo;re flowing when you lose track of time. In a way, it&rsquo;s the active form of meditation</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li><em>You are not your thoughts</em>. Your mind lies. It spins stories, fear, ego. But you, the awareness beyond the noise, are something deeper, calmer, truer.</li>
<li><em>Be present</em>. &ldquo;There are no ordinary moments.&rdquo; Reality is always now. Regret, worry, memory, planning&ndash;all illusions. Truth lives in the present.</li>
<li><em>Action is the path</em>. Knowing means nothing without doing. Act without hesitation. &ldquo;A warrior acts; only a fool reacts.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Surrender the outcome.</em> “You don&rsquo;t have to control everything—you just have to do your best.” Train hard, give fully, then let go. The results aren&rsquo;t yours.</li>
<li><em>Discipline and surrender coexist.</em> Train like a monk, move like a fighter, rest like a child. Strength without aggression. Surrender without weakness.</li>
<li><em>Service and purpose over ego.</em> Your life is not about proving yourself. It’s about waking up—becoming a force of presence, clarity, and love in action.</li>
<li><em>The warrior’s strength is internal.</em> Not control over others. But control over the only battlefield that matters: yourself.</li>
<li>“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.”</li>

<li><strong>Asthma and Sensitivity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Asthmatics are highly attuned to their environment—room size, air, proximity, smell.</li>
<li>The condition instills a deep sense of vulnerability, often leading to early existential awareness.</li>
<li>They know they’re <em>different</em>, even defective, yet sometimes the center of intense attention—creating a craving for more.</li>
<li>Other ailments are often endured stoically; asthma uniquely undermines stability and identity.</li>
<li>Asthma teaches: life is a battle. One must fight or fold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Teedie (T.R.) and Asthma</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attacks struck Saturdays, pre-church. Linked to being boxed in.</li>
<li>Salvation was <em>Papa</em> and <em>outside</em>: adventure, undivided attention, strength, and example.
<ul>
<li>Built confidence</li>
<li>Played outdoors</li>
<li>Provided companionship</li>
<li>Modeled strength</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Developmental Impact</strong>
<ul>
<li>Teedie, sensitive and intelligent, was deeply shaped—outlook, personality, self-worth.</li>
<li>Parental identification is critical.
<ul>
<li><em>Teedie chose his father</em>—strength, action.</li>
<li><em>Proust chose his mother</em>—sensitivity, retreat.
<ul>
<li>Result: reclusive, fragile, yet creatively gifted.</li>
<li>Some see asthma as a cry for the absent parent.</li>
<li>Proust never transcended victimhood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action Philosophy</strong>
<ul>
<li>“I am to do everything for myself.” —T.R., age 12</li>
<li>“Get action.” —T.R.</li>
<li>“Organs are made for action&hellip; to <em>work</em>, not merely <em>be</em>.” —Salter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Asthma creates a fork: helplessness vs. tenacity.</li>
<li>Teedie chose to fight—became “extremely tenacious of life.”</li>
<li>The goal is to transform the child from passive patient to active participant.</li>
