<p><a href="/breathing">Breathing</a> is the sword that slashes thought.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to figure it all out, so instead of trying to untanble the spaghetti loop of thinking, use breathing to slash it all up.</p>
<p>You will never stop the flow of thoughts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the goal. The goal is training your attention muscle to refocus over and over and over. Focus on the breath &ndash; in and out. Once you lose it and start focusing on something else (e.g. your thoughts), return to focusing about the breath.</p>
<p>Meditation is the art of learning to 1) notice your mind is wandering and 2) bring it back to the present &ndash; any focus you choose.</p>
<p>At first, it&rsquo;s breathing. But eventually, meditation can extend into every aspect of <a href="/living">living</a>. Cleaning dishes becomes meditation &ndash; just focus on the actions. Brushing teeth becomes meditation &ndash; focus on perfect form.</p>

<p><strong>Robin Wall Kimmerer</strong>, <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“All flourishing is mutual.”</li>
<li>“In some Native languages the term for plants translates to ‘those who take care of us.’”</li>
<li>“The acknowledgment of our mutual interdependence with the world is a necessary step toward reciprocity.”</li>
<li>The foundation for good living is gratitude and appreciation for all of the gifts that nature has given us – fresh air to breathe, solid ground to support us, fresh water from the rains and rivers to hydrate us, all of the beautiful wild plants, the food plants that nourish us, the medicine plants that heal us, the tiny creatures (bugs, bacteria) which help us live, the fish that clean the waters and provide us with meat, the amphibians and reptiles that wander the earth, the birds in the sky that share their beautiful music, the mammals that surround us and give us their meat, the sun in the sky giving us warmth, the moon and stars overhead, the wisdom keepers which pass down this knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wendell Berry</strong>, <em>The Unsettling of America</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Love someone who does not deserve it.”</li>
<li>“The earth is what we all have in common.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jesus</strong>, <em>Sermon on the Mount</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Epiousion” is a Koine Greek word meaning something like “bread for today and tomorrow.” The Sermon on the Mount is widely regarded as a distillation of Jesus’ teachings, and I find this word particularly interesting. The point is to request our <em>epiousion</em> from God and nothing more, to request a life of poverty basically, and be happy with that, and then all good things will stem from it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>John Steinbeck</strong>, <em>East of Eden</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Timshel” means you may. You don’t have to be good, but you may be good.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Victor Frankl</strong>, <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>All that matters is how we respond to our circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> by the United Nations</p>
<p><strong>Paulo Coehlo</strong>, <em>The Alchemist</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Maktoub” means it is written, but even though the path is written, it’s still our choice to go down it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>, <em>Rocky Balboa</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Watching you grow up was a privliege. Then the time come for you to take on the world and be your own man, and you did, but somewhere along the line, you changed.</p>
<p>You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you’re no good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame. Like a big shadow.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place. And I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you permanently there if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.</p>
<p>But it ain’t about how hard you hit, it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!</p>
<p>Now if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you want to be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that, and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!</p>
<p>I’m always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You’re my son, you’re my blood. You’re the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in yourself, you ain’t gonna have a life.</p>
<p>-Rocky, <em>Rocky Balboa</em></p>

<h3 id="air">AIR</h3>
<p><strong>Frank Herbert</strong>, <em>Dune</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Lift is not a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nick Saban</strong>, <em>The Process</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>How you do one thing is how you do everything.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eliezer Yudkowsky</strong>, <em>Something to Protect</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rationality/thinking is not the end-goal. They are tools to help you protect what you love. If you want to get to the Moon, science is way more useful than astrology for getting there, but science/rationality doesn&rsquo;t give you the desire to get there. Wisdom is all about getting what you desire efficiently (because <a href="/time">we don&rsquo;t have forever</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miyamoto Musashi</strong>, <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, 1645. A gold mine of wisdom.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Truth is not what you want it to be; it is what it is; and you must bend to its power or live a lie.&rdquo;</li>
<li>“The way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death.”</li>
<li>“The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy&rsquo;s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.”</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you know the way broadly you will see it in everything.&rdquo; &ldquo;You must understand that there is more than one path to the top of the mountain.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do not waste time idling or thinking after you have set your goals.&rdquo;</li>
<li>“There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alan Watts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="water">WATER</h3>
<p><strong>Coach Eric Taylor</strong>, <em>Friday Night Lights</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Clear eyes. Full hearts. Can&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thich Nhat Hanh</strong>, <em>How to Sit</em>, and <em>How to Love</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loving presence is the best gift you can give to someone.</li>
<li>“Silence is essential. We need silence just as much as we need air, just as much as plants need light.”</li>
<li>“Understanding is love’s other name. If you don’t understand, you can’t love.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brene Brown</strong> talks a lot about shame and wholehearted living as the antidote to shame. I love her advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Daring greatly means being vulnerable.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jonathan Haidt</strong>, <em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em>. My notes on <a href="/happiness">happiness</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</strong> came up with the concept of <em>Flow</em>, where a person is totally locked-in, dialed, in-the-zone, and makes us happy as humans.</p>
<p><strong>Simple acts of kindess</strong> &ndash; a Thai commercial I found on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1i0il8q/if_taoism_had_a_tv_spot_the_original_post_with/">reddit</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A normal worker, going about his day.</li>
<li>Stumbles upon small opportunities to improve the life of another.
<ul>
<li>Small plant on the side of the road.</li>
<li>Grumpy street food vendor struggling with their cart.</li>
<li>Hungry dog wagging its tail, paw on your leg.</li>
<li>A woman and her daughter begging for education money.</li>
<li>The old lady next door who could use some fresh bananas.</li>
<li>A tired healthcare worker standing on the bus next to your seat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With a smile and a joke, he helps every time.</li>
<li>Small acts of kindness, repeated over and over.</li>
<li>Add up to a life of joy.</li>
<li>I cry every time I watch this commercial.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fire">FIRE</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Thumos</em>. The spirited fire in the soul, source of courage, hunger, and glory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dan Millman</strong>, <em>The Way of the Peaceful Warrior</em>, and <em>The Journey of the Peaceful Warrior</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You are not your thoughts</em>. Your mind lies. It spins stories, fear, ego. But you, the awareness beyond the noise, are something deeper, calmer, truer.</li>
<li><em>Be present</em>. &ldquo;There are no ordinary moments.&rdquo; Reality is always now. Regret, worry, memory, planning&ndash;all illusions. Truth lives in the present.</li>
<li><em>Action is the path</em>. Knowing means nothing without doing. Act without hesitation. &ldquo;A warrior acts; only a fool reacts.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Surrender the outcome.</em> “You don&rsquo;t have to control everything—you just have to do your best.” Train hard, give fully, then let go. The results aren&rsquo;t yours.</li>
<li><em>Discipline and surrender coexist.</em> Train like a monk, move like a fighter, rest like a child. Strength without aggression. Surrender without weakness.</li>
<li><em>Service and purpose over ego.</em> Your life is not about proving yourself. It’s about waking up—becoming a force of presence, clarity, and love in action.</li>
<li><em>The warrior’s strength is internal.</em> Not control over others. But control over the only battlefield that matters: yourself.</li>
<li>“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>John Keating</strong>, <em>Dead Poets Society</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Joe Delaney</strong>, YouTube</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about making the right choice, it&rsquo;s about making the choice the right one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jocko Willink</strong>, <em>Extreme Ownership</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Own everything</em> - No one else is coming. No one else is responsible. Everything in your life &ndash; every win, failure, delay, excuse &ndash; is on you.</li>
<li><em>There are no bad teams, only bad leaders</em> - If the people around you are weak, soft, lazy, confused &ndash; <em>you allowed it</em>. You set the tone. You show the standard.</li>
<li><em>Discipline equals freedom</em> - You want freedom? Earn it. Discipline in the small things &ndash; waking up, training, planning &ndash; creates freedom in the big things.</li>
<li><em>Check the ego</em> - Ego destroys awareness. When you&rsquo;re humble, you adapt. Whe you&rsquo;re arrogant, you die.</li>
<li><em>Prioritize and execute</em> - Don&rsquo;t panic. Don&rsquo;t freeze. When shit gets chaotic: breathe, pick the most important target, crush it. Repeat.</li>
<li><em>Cover and move</em> - Work as a unit, if you&rsquo;re doing it all alone, you&rsquo;re not leading. But if you&rsquo;re not pulling your weight, you&rsquo;re a liability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>, <em>Meditations</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Derek Sivers</strong>, <em>Hell Yes or No</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your actions reveal your real values.</li>
<li>Two responses: 1) stop lying to yourself and admit your real priorities or 2) start doing what you say you want to do to see if it&rsquo;s really true</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Better Ideas</strong> (Joey Schweizer), YouTube.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVVQkZtnAU">Inaction Is A Slow Death</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike Tyson</strong>, professional boxer.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I would close my eyes and imagine the fights. I would imagine myself beating them—hurting them. I was never afraid.&quot;</li>
<li>“Whatever you put out into the universe, it comes back to you. I always used to say: ‘I’m the best ever. I’m the most brutal and vicious, the most ruthless champion there’s ever been.’ And eventually… I believed it.”</li>
<li>“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</li>
<li>&ldquo;Discipline is doing what you hate to do but doing it like you love it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fear is your best friend or your worst enemy. It&rsquo;s like fire. If you can control it, it can cook for you; it can heat your house. If you can&rsquo;t control it, it will burn everything around you and destroy you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I’m just ferocious.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teddy Roosevelt</strong>, former USA President</p>
