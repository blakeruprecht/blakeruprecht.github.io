      <description>This is all of my published work from my time as a Research Assistant before and during my stint in graduate school. I linked some PDFs as well.
For roughly five years, I studied the AI Alignment problem and created more eXplainable (XAI) and trustworthy AI algorithms to solve this problem. It is still unsolved. My research specifically focused on developing new mathematical techniques to bridge the gap between probabilistic neural networks and symbolic human reasoning.</description>
