      <description> Train every muscle 5 sets per week to maintain performance
Generally, group the muscles into four categories: Pushers: upper/middle/lower chest, front deltoid, triceps Pullers: upper/middle/lower traps, lattisimus dorsi, rear deltoid, biceps Hinge: back core, glutes, hamstrings, front calfs Squat: front core, side core, glutes, quads, back calfs Remember, performance is based on:
Technique/Skill: how well the joints moves through space Strength: how much mass you can lift Speed: how fast you can contract your muscles Power: strength times speed Endurance: how many reps of a given exercise you can do Hypertrophy: the size of the muscle </description>

      <title>My quest for the perfect bowl of Noodle Soup</title>

      <description>Holy shit, it&amp;rsquo;s all coming together. After watching Kung Fu Panda as a kid, I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving a delicious Asian nooodle-soup dish. Instant ramen is a good solution for $1 and a heart attack, but I want something fresh, wholesome, and delicious. Before this journey, ramen never did it for me, and other dishes like Pad Thai and Lo Mein just didn&amp;rsquo;t hit the spot.
I never liked Thai food, and I&amp;rsquo;m a serious food explorer.</description>

      <title>Do it yourself EV charger installation</title>
      <link>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/install-ev-charger/</link>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/install-ev-charger/</guid>
      <description>For the record, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend you install an EV charger yourself if you have no electrical experience. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely dangerous, and if you mess up, you can very easily catch your house on fire, or worse. However, it&amp;rsquo;s cool to at least now the process in theory, and this way, you can see if your electrician is doing it properly as well.
How much does it cost? If it was free, everyone would do it.</description>

      <description>I ate a scorpion in Bangkok and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good. The outer shell dominated the texture, and the meat tasted vaguely stale. Would not recommend.
I also ate grasshoppers, crickets, mealworms, and bamboo worms. I liked them all, and liked the mealworms so much I bought them many more times for a crunchy snack. They reminded me of a meatier cheese puff &amp;ndash; salty, crunchy, and airy. The crickets had much more substance to them, but were suprisingly good, with a roasted, fishy flavor.</description>

      <description>Physics Primer Work is equal to force times distance. Squatting your own weight plus 100 kilograms accomplishes the same amount of work regardless of how fast you do it. If you go really slow, let&amp;rsquo;s say it takes you 100 seconds, and you travel a vertical distance of 1 meter down and 1 meter back up. Technically this accomplishes zero work, but we&amp;rsquo;ll take the absolute value for fun.
W = |fd| f = ma (more precisely, f = (d/dt)(mv)) W = |mad| W = |(100 kgs)(10 m/s^2)(2 m)| = 2000 Joules = 478 cal = 0.</description>

      <title>I learned Python through AI research</title>
      <link>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/ai-to-learn-python/</link>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/ai-to-learn-python/</guid>
      <description>I learned Python as an AI researcher, since Python is the industry standard for open-source AI software. Python isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly good at any one thing language wise, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the jack-of-all-trades, can do anything language, so it&amp;rsquo;s great for prototyping algorithms that don&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. It took me forever to realize that most of what people were doing with Python wasn&amp;rsquo;t that complicated. Even though there are a million different packages to learn, each package basically does one thing, and does it well.</description>

      <description>Check out K Boges on Youtube, he explains this exercise theory better than I possibly could. All of his videos are very short, and he gets right to the point each time. A modern day youtube hero.
Training Cardio Perhaps the single most important thing to train for overall health is cardiovascular endurance, the ability of your heart and lungs to provide oxygen and energy to the entire body. There are three metabolic pathways: anaerobic, aerobic, and long-duration.</description>

      <title>KISS nutrition is Mediterranean diet</title>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.github.io/blog/kiss-nutrition/</guid>
      <description>Summary Let&amp;rsquo;s get something out of the way &amp;ndash; there is no magic diet, pill you can take, or one-stop solution to nutrition &amp;ndash; at least not yet. If you expect to find an easy solution, find someone trying to sell you something. The hard truth is that human nutrition is complicated, there are a lot of essential nutrients we need, and there aren&amp;rsquo;t many shortcuts to eating natural, whole food.</description>

      <description>Why bother? I come from an engineering and coding background, so take everything I say here with a grain of salt &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve spent way too much time tinkering and fiddling with this stuff to get it all to work, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s been worth it. Why? To take back control of my stuff. In case you want to do it to, I can point you in the right direction -&amp;gt; FOSS.</description>

      <description>The greatest distance between two places is through time. When I listen to music, occasionally a song will play that instantly transports me back to a specific moment in time, filling me with vivid memories of a moment I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget. When I play through these songs, I relive moments like they just happened.
Somewhere in the Middle One moment, it&amp;rsquo;s a hot and humid day somewhere in the middle of a damp Missouri summer.</description>

      <description>The Basics I want to enjoy life as much as possible. I can guarantee that you do too. Everyone I know pretty much wants the same things out of life &amp;ndash; friendships, good food, plenty of sleep, a healthy body, a calm mind. Tons of money? Only insofar as it buys you food, a place to live, plenty of warm clothes, and some beers to share with our friends. Most of the time, we seek things outside of the basics because of what we lack.</description>

      <description>Simple living is natural, easy, frugal, spiritual, sustainable, economical, healthy, fun, connected, and anarchist. All of the great teachers of the world have advocated for simple living: Pooh Bear, Hobbes (not Calvin), dogs &amp;amp; cats, Baloo, all trees, Uncle Iroh, Lao Tzu, the Lorax. Simple living is sexy!

      <description>The tattoo on my achilles heel is an X. If you squint, it kind of looks like an intersection, or a crossroad. To me, this represents indecision, my biggest weakness, and the thing I regret most in life &amp;ndash; not taking action to pursue love over fear. As I sit here at another crossroad, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think of the lyrics from the song that inspired the ink:
I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the crossroad,</description>

      <description>I recently completed a four month trip around Southeast Asia and Europe lasting from February through June. Prior to this, I traveled around the USA pretty extensively for some months. I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled a lot over the past few years, but this was by far the most travel I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done in a one-year period. I probably spent most of the year living out of my backpack, and I learned a lot of lessons while doing it.</description>

      <description>I went grocery shopping with my buddy recently and was totally baffled when we did the unthinkable: we backtracked. We went back to the produce section not once, but twice, making three total trips through the same section. Grocery shopping is my least favorite part of the eating experience, yet it seems to be a necessity for most people. My garden is non-existent, and my foraging skills are abysmal, so the next best option is to take my hard-earned cash into the big unwindowed box of fluorescent lighting and try to navigate the dense forest of packaged items.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY: Change your mindset to prioritize growth by praising yourself for effort, hard-work, and learning. Talk to yourself like a friend, don&amp;rsquo;t try to be perfect, and engage in positive self-talk. Eventually, you will be making more progress than you ever were with a fixed mindset.
1. What is growth mindset A growth mindset is when you believe you can improve at anything with time and effort. Instead of seeing challenges as an internal problem, you see them as a chance to get better and improve.</description>

How to brew well Water: 40% of the flavor Fresh beans: 40% of the flavor Freshly ground: 10% of the flavor Brewing consistency: 10% of the flavor The process References Why brew yourself? I go to coffee shops and do not understand how cold brew coffee costs significantly more than hot brew. It must be down to marketing, and the fact that people who don&amp;rsquo;t give a hoot typically aren&amp;rsquo;t going to coffee shops.</description>

      <description>Previously, I was an Artificial Intelligence research assistant at the University of Missouri (MIZ-ZOU!) working with Derek Anderson and the Center for Geospatial Intelligence. Our work focused on eXplainable AI (XAI), specifically developing new neuro-fuzzy systems.
What did I research? I went to grad school to research the AI Alignment problem, which is similar to AI safety, AI risk research, etc. Alignment is more specific than safety because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean trustworthy and harmless, it also means beneficial.</description>

It seems so impossible before it happens. You see it approaching. You see all of the warning signs, all of the speed bumps preparing you for the abrupt stop ahead. Somber stories are repeated from old friends who are long past the days of sitting on rooftops at 2pm on a Tuesday, skipping class and drinking cold ones out of a squat, plastic cup, deciding that their responsibilities can be pushed off for at least two more hours, until they hit that Ballmer peak of &amp;ldquo;creativity&amp;rdquo; or whatever you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to call drunkenly typing meandering lines of thought and utilizing spell check way too much and re-doing it all the next morning anyway &amp;ndash; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>
