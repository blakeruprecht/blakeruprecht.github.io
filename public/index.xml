      <description>Lifting is fun, primal, joyful movement. You can lift 3 x/week (e.g. MoWeFr) doing a few basic exercises and be strong for life. Focus on compound lifts over isolation fluff. Increase weight when you can do 3x12 (track your lifts). Stick with one program and focus on progression, not complexity. Recovery builds muscle, so don&amp;rsquo;t overdo it.&#xA;Warm up by starting light on your first exercise 3x8-12 Legs: Hinge, Squat, or Split 3x8-12 Pull: Pullup/Chinup or Row 3x8-12 Push: Dip, Pushup/Bench, or Pike/OHP 3x8-12 Core: any variation Stretching options to warm-up or add after running to cool-down: Chin Tucks &amp;ndash; fix forward head tilt Wall Slides &amp;ndash; loosen up the shoulders (or Band Pull-Apart, Face Pull) Dead Hang &amp;ndash; loosen up the whole spine and shoulders Cobra &amp;ndash; loosen up the lower back and thoracic spine Couch Stretch &amp;ndash; loosen up tight hip flexors from sitting Deep Squat &amp;ndash; open up the hips Glute Bridge &amp;ndash; activate sleeping glutes (or Bird Dog) Related running </description>

Add speed or distance to improve.&#xA;Run two miles at Zone 2 pace. Zone 1: walking, still fun! Zone 2: easy pace (nose-breathing) Zone 3-4: tempo/intervals Zone 5: sprints Related lifting </description>

      <description>All you really need are the basic compound lifts in order to build muscle.&#xA;There are a million and one different exercises using different equipment to target every muscle in a myriad of different ways. It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming. Luckily, most of those options are useless for the average person. As with anything, the fundamental lifts are basic and provide most of the returns.&#xA;In general, the fundamental lifts can be broken up into the major movement patterns: the squat, the hinge/lift, the pull, and the push.</description>

      <description>Cycle to travel distances under 2 miles. Cycling is fun, faster than walking, and cheaper than driving. It gets you outside. Bicycles are around $200 and easy to maintain. A human is not very efficient walking or running, but with a bicycle, is more efficient than a horse. Stay safe, use hand signals, lock your bike, and get a headlight and taillight if you travel at night.</description>

      <description>Disc Golf is fun. It&amp;rsquo;s played at courses that are usually free. It&amp;rsquo;s a great sport to drink and smoke during.&#xA;Chill out a bit. Get up there and rip it. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a million discs to play, just 1. Start with a midrange for everything, add a putter to improve your close game, add a fairway driver for drives over 300 feet, and finally, add a distance driver once you have the skill and speed to throw one.</description>

      <description>Any exercise causes a growth response. To keep improving, two conditions must be met:&#xA;Progressive Overload ‚Äî The body adapts to repeated stress. To trigger further adaptation, you must increase the stimulus. lifting: increase sets, reps, or weight running: increase pace, distance, or time under tension Sufficient Recovery ‚Äî Adaptation only happens when the body has resources to rebuild. sleeping: growth happens during deep sleep eating-anabolic: protein + calories enable growth drinking: hydration aids recovery and performance Muscle Adaptations (per muscle) Technique - more efficient and precise movement Strength - increased force output Speed - faster execution of the movement Power - strength x speed (explosiveness) Endurance - ability to repeat the movement Size - hypertrophy Energy System Adaptations Anaerobic Endurance - short bursts (e.</description>

      <description>View sunlight upon waking for 10 minutes (30 if it&amp;rsquo;s overcast) to set your circadian rhythym, the bodies natural process to determine when to get tired and when to stay alert.&#xA;View sunlight as much as possible throughout the day to keep yourself awake.&#xA;View sunlight right before sunset to help tell the body to start winding down for the evening.&#xA;Avoid viewing any bright lights after sundown if possible, and especially after 9pm when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go to sleep.</description>

      <description>While walking is my preferred mode of traveling, it&amp;rsquo;s by far the slowest. Cycling is my preferred option for short distances, and driving when I need to go fast or far.&#xA;Bicycles for cycling Any bicycle is pretty much fine Bicycles actually come in different sizes, so for my 1.92 m frame, I typically need a L or XL sized bicycle. Helmets are essential for not dying in a crash. Looks lame though.</description>

      <description>I have beer in my blood. I&amp;rsquo;m from STL, the city in the US with the best brewing tradition (in my very biased opinion). I love drinking beer with my best buds and my family.&#xA;A book I read recently (Drunk by Edward Slingerland) makes a fascinating argument that alcohol was basically the reason humans settled down to start farming, since alcohol improves human creativity by lowering inhibitions, leading to better cooperation due to trust derived from drinking rituals, enabling humans to build larger and more successful communities.</description>

      <description>Setpoints The biological basis of human happiness is our neurochemical setpoints, which is the resting level of things like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, etc in the brain. They are mostly genetic and very hard to change.&#xA;If these are out of whack and making you unhappy, there are only three scientifically proven interventions to fix them:&#xA;Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: The most highly regarded type of therapy which helps us identify our cognitive biases and distortions (untruths) and correct them to alter our brain chemistry.</description>

      <description>Sleep is important for everything, I just don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what. Sleep for roughly 8 hours per night, but this number is unique to each person. Maintain cool temperatures in your sleeping room with plenty of blankets to get comfortable. Sunlight is the main mechanism for waking up the body, and darkness is the main mechanism for telling the body to sleep. Wake a consistent time to set a sleep schedule and go to sleep when your body naturally feels tired.</description>

      <description>An agent is an active part of their environment. Action is something an agent does that changes the environment. Active - part of the environment that takes action (alive), e.g. humans, dogs, all animals and plants that do stuff. Passive - part of the environment that do nothing (dead), e.g. fire, stars, planets, moons, dirt, sand, water, air, etc. Agency refers to how active a part of the environment the agent is: something with high agency performs a lot of actions that change the environment.</description>

      <description>Your &amp;ldquo;being&amp;rdquo; or character is determined by what you repeatedly &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo;, or the actions you take. Character is the shape your entire being takes because of your habits. It&amp;rsquo;s the sum of your virtues and vices. It&amp;rsquo;s what you consistently are. Any action can become a virtue or a vice, depending on the thoughts and feelings that accompany the action.&#xA;What you say and do when nobody else is watching. What you fall back to under pressure.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A computer is like a bicycle for the mind.&amp;rdquo; -Steve Jobs&#xA;Computing is powerful because it&amp;rsquo;s a direct extension of thinking. Just like language, it abstracts information into more easily transmittalbe forms to enable communication, the sharing of information from brain to brain.&#xA;Computing is all about understanding layers of abstraction. A computer is powerful because it&amp;rsquo;s not a fixed object, but rather a tool that changes itself through time, so it&amp;rsquo;s a process.</description>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.com/dopamine/</guid>
      <description>One of the most important neurochemicals to regulate with behavior.&#xA;Dopamine is the chemical that drives pursuit, it is literally the life giving spark in all animals.&#xA;Dopamine doesn&amp;rsquo;t make us feel pleasure, it makes us pursue things. When we get pleasure without pursuit, aka heroin, drugs, porn-fueled masturbation, etc., it messes up our dopamine system. Dopamine gets jacked up in anticipation of easy pleasures, then crashes afterwards, preventing us from pursuing other things.</description>

      <description>Anabolism refers to the body being in a state of growth. If you want to grow as a child, or build muscle as a child/adult, you will need to eat an excess of calories and protein to grow.&#xA;Eat more calories. Even +1 calorie per day over maintenance will increase your weight. +3500 calories corresponds to roughly 1 pound of weight gain. Do +500 per day is 3500 or a pound per week, a very rapid gaining schedule.</description>

      <description>I am an agent in my environment, which is the entire universe (spacetime). My environment changes through time, which helps me orient myself in my environment. I can take action to change the environment. I can never know everything about the environment, instead a make a best guess based on my current state and trajectory.&#xA;A Glass of Wine &amp;ldquo;The whole universe fits into a glass of wine.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;If we split nature up into pieces to make discussion easier, nature does not know it!</description>

      <description>WHO: Me WHEN: dunno yet WHERE: gym HOW: 0. Tools: clothes, fighting equipment IDK, still figuring out how to incorporate this into my life. Why I enjoyed hitting the heavy bag every time I&amp;rsquo;ve had access to one. Punching feels good. Very fun. Great energy burner. Very hard on the muscles and endurance. &amp;ldquo;Si vis pacem, para bellum.&amp;rdquo; If you wish for peace, prepare for war. Like Mr. Miyagi said, the best reason to learn to fight is so that you never have to.</description>

Optionally, get a reel, a circle thing to wind the line around. Optionally, get a pole that holds the string and/or reel in place. Put some bait on the hook. You can use worms, hot dogs, grubs you pick up from the ground, bugs you catch, or artificial lures/flies.</description>

      <description>Keep an enduring list I keep one Grocery List on my phone in the notes app, with checkboxes enabled. This way at the store, I check off everything I buy. During the week, whenever I run out of an ingredient, I uncheck that item on my phone list. This way, I always have a list I&amp;rsquo;m updating, and anytime I happen to enter into a grocery store, I can pull out my phone and know exactly what I need at that moment (or at least have a good guess).</description>

      <description>An agent&amp;rsquo;s predicted best course of action through time to get from the current state to a reward state.&#xA;The policy describes a future trajectory of state-action pairs which lead to a state in which the agent&amp;rsquo;s perceived reward is high.&#xA;A policy is an approximation, since any individual agent has an incomplete description of their state, as well as an incomplete memory, as well as incomplete knowledge of the environment to predict the future.</description>

      <guid>https://blakeruprecht.com/predicting/</guid>
      <description>My brain predicts the statistical association between state-action pairs and rewards gained from those states. It learns to associate state-action pairs with rewards that happen well into the future after said state-action pairs through statistical association. Basically, if a specific action in a specific state keeps leading to the reward, keep doing that action in that state.</description>

      <description>j- Reward is a state of an agent&amp;rsquo;s environment that produces positive thinking for that agent.&#xA;Rewarding states are the result of genetic factors, internal drives, thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Reward is different for every agent. Agents are ultimately the choosers of their actions, and they make choices based on what they predict will maximize reward based on their current sensations and understanding of the past.

      <description>Sensing refers to the thinking processes agents use to detect changing states of their environment. As a human, I have external senses and internal senses which gather data about the state of my local environment. External sensing gathers state data about the environment &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; of my body. Seeing: sensing the change in light/color levels around me, perceived as sight. Hearing: sensing the change in air pressure around me, perceived as sound.</description>

      <description>A trajectory is a sequence/history of state-action-reward information about an agents personal experience in its environment. A trajectory can be thought of as the history of an agent, all of their lived experiences, their story, their memory, their past, their knowledge.&#xA;A trajectory is basically the facts about what actions were taken in what states, what new states the agent entered into, the next actions they took in that state, and so on.</description>

      <description>Understanding is the thinking process of paying attention to relevant sensed information from the past and present. Memory is the stored history of past relevant trajectory information based on our understanding in the past. Attention is our ability to prioritize state-action information based on high/low reward signals. Our brains aren&amp;rsquo;t big enough to store every trajectory of experience into memory, so we choose to keep informatoin that is relevant, new, or surprising.</description>

Me too, so I learned the basic building blocks of any website.&#xA;At it&amp;rsquo;s core, every website is just text and images. Everything else is style.&#xA;HTML HTML is the &amp;ldquo;coding language&amp;rdquo; that tells a web browser what words and pictures correspond to headings, paragraphs, navbars, captions, etc. HTML basically just tells a browser what words are &amp;ldquo;paragraph&amp;rdquo; text, &amp;ldquo;headings&amp;rdquo;, or more confusingly, part of the &amp;ldquo;header&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;footer&amp;rdquo; of a website, including the &amp;ldquo;navbar&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Writing refers to physical pictures which represent our spoken language. These pictures take the form of letters and numbers, and a combination of these form words, which combine to form sentences and paragraphs, all of which is called text.&#xA;Writing communicates thoughts in the form of written information to share ideas from brain to brain.&#xA;What does writing do? A writer&amp;rsquo;s role can be understood in several ways, depending on the context and purpose of their work, but at the core, writers aim to communicate ideas, tell stories, and share information.</description>

      <description>Humans burn energy just by breathing, let alone all the energy required to work, think, run, hug, lift, cook, gather food, etc. Humans are biological machines that turn hamburgers and beer into more humans. In order to do that properly, we need to keep powering ourselves by ingesting food that we can digest for calories.&#xA;IN = OUT To maintain total body mass/weight, eat the same amount of calories as you burn.</description>

      <description>Macronutrients refer to large chemical molecules which are the primary components of all the cells in our bodies. These molecules are composed of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and more elements/atoms. These molecules all come in many different forms, but as a whole they are grouped into the following categories for ease of discussion and energy counting.&#xA;Macronutrients are the primary source of energy for the body, as well as the primary source of building material for the body (proteins, fats, and carbs form most of the cells of the body).</description>

At the turn of the 20th century, STL was the 4th largest city in the USA. STL was strongly influenced by the presence of the then-largest brewery in the world (Anheuser-Busch) and shares a lot of Midwestern culture due to the large presence of German immigrants.</description>

      <description>Barbarian roots For most of human history, the Earth was not covered by political nations which controlled every patch of land, like they do now. The world domination by civilization was incomplete. Up until at least the 1500s AD, there were still huge swaths of territory controlled by nobody in particular. Sure, roving bands of hunter-gatherers controlled portions of territory, but with armies so small even the Roman Empire would blush.</description>

      <description>Black ink on white paper, mostly.&#xA;Shadow is the big question with this medium &amp;ndash; how do you represent shades of gray?&#xA;You only have two colors, usually limited at the minimum in line thickness by the width of your pen nib (I typically use 0.5 mm).&#xA;You can use hasing, stippling, and other techniques to create texture and the appearance of shadow. The denser the ink in a given area, the darker the area will appear from afar.</description>

      <description>For the record, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend you install an EV charger yourself if you have no electrical experience. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely dangerous, and if you mess up, you can very easily catch your house on fire, or worse. However, it&amp;rsquo;s cool to at least now the process in theory, and this way, you can see if your electrician is doing it properly as well.&#xA;How much does it cost?

      <description>I ate a scorpion in Bangkok and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good. The outer shell dominated the texture, and the meat tasted vaguely stale. Would not recommend.&#xA;I also ate grasshoppers, crickets, mealworms, and bamboo worms. I liked them all, and liked the mealworms so much I bought them many more times for a crunchy snack. They reminded me of a meatier cheese puff &amp;ndash; salty, crunchy, and airy. The crickets had much more substance to them, but were suprisingly good, with a roasted, fishy flavor.</description>

Being intelligent is not the ability to learn 100 digits of Pi. That&amp;rsquo;s just pure computation. Being intelligent is reciting those digits to a girl you have a crush on, but only if it works. If she gets the ick, then that behavior was dumb, unless you were purely competing with yourself, in which case it&amp;rsquo;s back to being smart.</description>

This mentality makes you less likely to quit, and much more likely to hit your goals. Basically, challenge your beliefs about yourself, and switch your fixed mindset (e.</description>

Data is given to the neural network, and then the robot does some calculations and tests it&amp;rsquo;s performance against the environment.&#xA;Supervised Learning (SL) Data comes with labels. The network makes an initial random guess at what the labels should be. Then, it compares the guesses to the actual labels, and determines how off it was (total error).

Thinking is the bodily process of choosing which action to take in every moment. To act is to live. Living is the process of taking action in every moment. When thinking/acting stops, we die. Sometimes we say we&amp;rsquo;re doing nothing, but we&amp;rsquo;re always doing some actions (e.g. breathing) until death. Your life is a string of actions.</description>

      <description>$$ Motivation = \frac{Expectancy \cdot Value}{Impulsiveness \cdot Delay} $$ Step 1: Notice I&amp;rsquo;m procrastinating I know I should do a task Step 2: Which part of the equation is the problem? Expectancy: Do I not think I&amp;rsquo;ll succeed? Is the task too hard? Will I actually get the reward? Value: Am I bored/distracted/uncomfortable/grumpy/in pain? Am I nervous or afraid of the outcome? Do I care about the task? Impulsiveness: am I impatient?</description>

      <description>Neural networks are universal function approximators, according to the Universal function approximation theorem. Neural Networks eventually got deeper and more sophisticated, becoming the single most useful tool for artificial intelligence.&#xA;The Perceptron (I&amp;rsquo;m just P), basically a straight line Similar to a brain neuron. The perceptron is basically a function that fits a straight-line relationship between a range of input values and some corresponding output values.&#xA;For example, to represent no relationship between input and output, you would have a neuron that outputs Y = 0 for every input value X.</description>

Somber stories are repeated from old friends who are long past the days of sitting on rooftops at 2pm on a Tuesday, skipping class and drinking cold ones out of a squat, plastic cup, deciding that their responsibilities can be pushed off for at least two more hours, until they hit that Ballmer peak of &amp;ldquo;creativity&amp;rdquo; or whatever you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to call drunkenly typing meandering lines of thought and utilizing spell check way too much and re-doing it all the next morning anyway &amp;ndash; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

      <description>WEIRD: Among the most prominent features that make people WEIRD is prioritizing impersonal pro-sociality over interpersonal relationships. Impersonal psychology includes inclinations to trust strangers or cooperating with anonymous others. Another big one is having high levels of individualism, meaning a focus on the self and one‚Äôs attributes. This is often accompanied by tendencies toward self-enhancement and overconfidence. WEIRD people also rely heavily on analytic thinking over more holistic approaches to problems.</description>

This is nothing new, it&amp;rsquo;s basic trial and error with some obvious rules to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not getting bad results - We don&amp;rsquo;t care about TRUTH in some amorphous sense, we care about being EFFECTIVE, because all scientific thought has been tested.</description>

      <description>Adapt or die.&#xA;Learning is the constant process of the brain updating predictions based on new trajectories of information coming in. Trajectories can be shared from brain to brain through communication of information. Information is always an explanation of trajectories: what states and actions lead to what rewards.&#xA;Taking in more data (more information, gaining more knowledge) can help you predict future rewards better (wisdom, intelligence). This little loop, seemingly simple, is the most powerful tool humans have, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t even invent it.</description>

      <description>My environment is the entire universe, all of everything, reality.&#xA;Cosmic scale &amp;ndash; pale blue dot I am a bunch of electrical connections which animate jelly held in a sack of skin surrounding calcified rocks which can move.&#xA;I live on a big rock hurtling millions of miles per hour through a backwater of space.&#xA;My entire home is simple a mote of dust caught suspended in a sunbeam.&#xA;The whole universe in a glass of wine It only adds!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m from STL, MO, USA.&#xA;America is a confusing place to live. It&amp;rsquo;s the wealthiest country in the world, but not for most. It&amp;rsquo;s the most beautiful country in the world, but difficult to travel through. It&amp;rsquo;s a land of extremes. Extremely big, extremely fast, extremely brutal.&#xA;Everybody knows the USA is great in a lot of ways, and evil in others.&#xA;American spirit I&amp;rsquo;m still a fan. No, it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect.</description>

      <description>Initially, the Chinese and Mesopotamias dominate the world&amp;hellip; then the Sinic and Indic civilizations become the most powerful for centuries, along with some competition from MidEast civs (Babylon, Persia, Islam). Europe is a backwater for a long time, Africa is too heterogeneous and hot to be successful, the Americas are isolated from other cultures/civilizations Africa is very heterogeneous India/China are very homogeneous Mid-East and Europe are a mixture &amp;ndash; good for civilization turnover throughout history, bad for stability &amp;ndash; not as bad as Africa, not as good as China/India Europe is the most aggressive battleground on earth during the Middle Ages &amp;ndash; which makes it a fertile proving ground for ideas.</description>

      <description>There is no purpose or meaning to life, that we know of. Many people have come up with their own philosophies, which I see divided into three main categories.&#xA;Pleasure-seekers. Hedonists. Druggies. Whatever you want to call them, these people pursue pleasure above all else. Short term pleasure, here and now, instant gratification. These people want to chill and relax all day, doing nothing, soaking up the sunshine. Ascetics. Avoiders. These people see the suffering and pain in the world and want no part in it.</description>
